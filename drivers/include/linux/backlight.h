/* Notes on locking:
 *
 * backlight_device->ops_lock is an internal backlight lock protecting the
 * ops pointer and no code outside the core should need to touch it.
 *
 * Access to update_status() is serialised by the update_lock mutex since
 * most drivers seem to need this and historically get it wrong.
 *
 * Most drivers don't need locking on their get_brightness() method.
 * If yours does, you need to implement it in the driver. You can use the
 * update_lock mutex if appropriate.
 *
 * Any other use of the locks below is probably wrong.
