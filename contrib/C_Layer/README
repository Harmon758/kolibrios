This is the C Layer for KolibriOS.

Along with the C Library we have, this will serve as the backbone to easily use libraries aand programs available in C.
This is also useful for porting.
Also useful for new developers who don't know assembly but know C.

And the beauty is, this is NOT a reimplementation of assembly libraries in C.
It is only a wrapper on top of C.

As all new things, this will have issues and bugs!
Please fix it.
Please let the other developers know what's wrong and how to fix it.
If you can, fix it yourself!
