Welcome to the README for GUI LIBRARY FOR KOLIBRIOS IN C.

This library tries to use the wealth of code already written for KolibriOS in assembly.

The files currently available are : 

0) loadboxlib.asm :
   This is a wrapper created so that C can call assembly functions. 
   Assemble this to loadboxlib.obj and use with cross compiler linker the .obj file
   to create correct executables which use this GUI library.

1) kolibri_boxlib.h :
   This file contains functions for initializing boxlib from C. This is used by the
   function kolibri_gui_init() in kolibri_gui.h

2)kolibri_button.h:
	This file contains functions to create and use kolibriOS buttons.
	
3)kolibri_checkbox.h:
	This file contains functions to create and use Check boxes from BOXLIB.

4)kolibri_editbox.h:
	This file contains functions for creating text boxes (edit boxes from Boxlib)

5)kolibri_colors.h:
	This file has functions to initialize global kolibri color table
	so that the GUI can use colors from the System theme.

6)kolibri_gui_elements.h:
	This defines generic containers for GUI elements so that ANY element 
	(buttons, editboxes, checkboxes, etc) can have their redraw/mouse/key event
	functions. This helps create a list of all the elements and draw them together.

ALL FILES ABOVE ARE INCLUDED IN KOLIBRI_GUI.H SO THEY DO NOT NEED TO BE INCLUDED IN THE CODE YOU WRITE.

7)kolibri_gui.h:
	This is the master file we use. This baby contains everything you need (all GUI elements are included).
	This also contains event handlers that can be simply called from the main application loop.
	This will make your life easy on KolibriOS ;) USE IT!
	The function kolibri_gui_init() needs to be called from all applications using this library.

8)boardmsg.c:
	Sample application written to show off the library.
	This application sends messages to Debug Board on KolibriOS.
	Enter a msg and press the button with the mouse to send messages!
	This is the first of many applications to come with this library.
