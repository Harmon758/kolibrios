USE .section '.init' code for writing loader asm C mixed code (in FASM)
Got to know this by checking out the linker script on KGCC. -Xlinker -verbose .
Inside the .text section that is being assembled, the .init is placed at the very beginning.
Let the macros expand, GCC simply places .init on the top and therefore it works.

Inexplicable errors if .init is not used and .text or .flat is used... Took 4 hours to figure out.
