/**
 * Program key structures.
 *
 * When drawing, we look for the currently bound shaders in the program
 * cache.  This is essentially a hash table lookup, and these are the keys.
 *
 * Sometimes OpenGL features specified as state need to be simulated via
 * shader code, due to a mismatch between the API and the hardware.  This
 * is often referred to as "non-orthagonal state" or "NOS".  We store NOS
 * in the program key so it's considered when searching for a program.  If
 * we haven't seen a particular combination before, we have to recompile a
 * new specialized version.
 *
 * Shader compilation should not look up state in gl_context directly, but
 * instead use the copy in the program key.  This guarantees recompiles will
 * happen correctly.
