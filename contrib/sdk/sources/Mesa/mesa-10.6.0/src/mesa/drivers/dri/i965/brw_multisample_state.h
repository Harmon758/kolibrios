/**
 * Sample positions are based on a solution to the "8 queens" puzzle.
 * Rationale: in a solution to the 8 queens puzzle, no two queens share
 * a row, column, or diagonal.  This is a desirable property for samples
 * in a multisampling pattern, because it ensures that the samples are
 * relatively uniformly distributed through the pixel.
 *
 * There are several solutions to the 8 queens puzzle (see
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle).  This solution was
 * chosen because it has a queen close to the center; this should
 * improve the accuracy of centroid interpolation, since the hardware
 * implements centroid interpolation by choosing the centermost sample
 * that overlaps with the primitive being drawn.
 *
 * Note: from the Ivy Bridge PRM, Vol2 Part1 p304 (3DSTATE_MULTISAMPLE:
 * Programming Notes):
 *
 *     "When programming the sample offsets (for NUMSAMPLES_4 or _8 and
 *     MSRASTMODE_xxx_PATTERN), the order of the samples 0 to 3 (or 7
 *     for 8X) must have monotonically increasing distance from the
 *     pixel center. This is required to get the correct centroid
 *     computation in the device."
