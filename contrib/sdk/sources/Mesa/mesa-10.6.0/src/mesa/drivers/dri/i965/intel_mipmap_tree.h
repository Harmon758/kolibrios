/** @file intel_mipmap_tree.h
 *
 * This file defines the structure that wraps a BO and describes how the
 * mipmap levels and slices of a texture are laid out.
 *
 * The hardware has a fixed layout of a texture depending on parameters such
 * as the target/type (2D, 3D, CUBE), width, height, pitch, and number of
 * mipmap levels.  The individual level/layer slices are each 2D rectangles of
 * pixels at some x/y offset from the start of the drm_intel_bo.
 *
 * Original OpenGL allowed texture miplevels to be specified in arbitrary
 * order, and a texture may change size over time.  Thus, each
 * intel_texture_image has a reference to a miptree that contains the pixel
 * data sized appropriately for it, which will later be referenced by/copied
 * to the intel_texture_object at draw time (intel_finalize_mipmap_tree()) so
 * that there's a single miptree for the complete texture.
