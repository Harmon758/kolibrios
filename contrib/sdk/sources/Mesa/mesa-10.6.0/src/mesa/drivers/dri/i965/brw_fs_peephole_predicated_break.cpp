/** @file brw_fs_peephole_predicated_break.cpp
 *
 * Loops are often structured as
 *
 * loop:
 *    CMP.f0
 *    (+f0) IF
 *    BREAK
 *    ENDIF
 *    ...
 *    WHILE loop
 *
 * This peephole pass removes the IF and ENDIF instructions and predicates the
 * BREAK, dropping two instructions from the loop body.
 *
 * If the loop was a DO { ... } WHILE loop, it looks like
 *
 * loop:
 *    ...
 *    CMP.f0
 *    (+f0) IF
 *    BREAK
 *    ENDIF
 *    WHILE loop
 *
 * and we can remove the BREAK instruction and predicate the WHILE.
