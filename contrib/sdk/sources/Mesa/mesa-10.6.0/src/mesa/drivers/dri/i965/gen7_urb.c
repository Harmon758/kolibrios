/**
 * The following diagram shows how we partition the URB:
 *
 *        16kB or 32kB               Rest of the URB space
 *   __________-__________   _________________-_________________
 *  /                     \ /                                   \
 * +-------------------------------------------------------------+
 * |     VS/FS/GS Push     |              VS/GS URB              |
 * |       Constants       |               Entries               |
 * +-------------------------------------------------------------+
 *
 * Notably, push constants must be stored at the beginning of the URB
 * space, while entries can be stored anywhere.  Ivybridge and Haswell
 * GT1/GT2 have a maximum constant buffer size of 16kB, while Haswell GT3
 * doubles this (32kB).
 *
 * Ivybridge and Haswell GT1/GT2 allow push constants to be located (and
 * sized) in increments of 1kB.  Haswell GT3 requires them to be located and
 * sized in increments of 2kB.
 *
 * Currently we split the constant buffer space evenly among whatever stages
 * are active.  This is probably not ideal, but simple.
 *
 * Ivybridge GT1 and Haswell GT1 have 128kB of URB space.
 * Ivybridge GT2 and Haswell GT2 have 256kB of URB space.
 * Haswell GT3 has 512kB of URB space.
 *
 * See "Volume 2a: 3D Pipeline," section 1.8, "Volume 1b: Configurations",
 * and the documentation for 3DSTATE_PUSH_CONSTANT_ALLOC_xS.
