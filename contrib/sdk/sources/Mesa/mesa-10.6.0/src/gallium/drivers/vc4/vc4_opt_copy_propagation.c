/**
 * @file vc4_opt_copy_propagation.c
 *
 * This implements simple copy propagation for QIR without control flow.
 *
 * For each temp, it keeps a qreg of which source it was MOVed from, if it
 * was.  If we see that used later, we can just reuse the source value, since
 * we know we don't have control flow, and we have SSA for our values so
 * there's no killing to worry about.
