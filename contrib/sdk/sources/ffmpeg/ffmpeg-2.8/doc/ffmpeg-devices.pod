=head1 NAME

ffmpeg-devices - FFmpeg devices

=head1 DESCRIPTION


This document describes the input and output devices provided by the
libavdevice library.



=head1 DEVICE OPTIONS


The libavdevice library provides the same interface as
libavformat. Namely, an input device is considered like a demuxer, and
an output device like a muxer, and the interface and generic device
options are the same provided by libavformat (see the ffmpeg-formats
manual).

In addition each input or output device may support so-called private
options, which are specific for that component.

Options may be set by specifying -I<option> I<value> in the
FFmpeg tools, or by setting the value explicitly in the device
C<AVFormatContext> options or using the F<libavutil/opt.h> API
for programmatic use.



=head1 INPUT DEVICES


Input devices are configured elements in FFmpeg which enable accessing
the data coming from a multimedia device attached to your system.

When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported input devices
are enabled by default. You can list all available ones using the
configure option "--list-indevs".

You can disable all the input devices using the configure option
"--disable-indevs", and selectively enable an input device using the
option "--enable-indev=I<INDEV>", or you can disable a particular
input device using the option "--disable-indev=I<INDEV>".

The option "-devices" of the ff* tools will display the list of
supported input devices.

A description of the currently available input devices follows.


=head2 alsa


ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) input device.

To enable this input device during configuration you need libasound
installed on your system.

This device allows capturing from an ALSA device. The name of the
device to capture has to be an ALSA card identifier.

An ALSA identifier has the syntax:
	
	hw:<CARD>[,<DEV>[,<SUBDEV>]]


where the I<DEV> and I<SUBDEV> components are optional.

The three arguments (in order: I<CARD>,I<DEV>,I<SUBDEV>)
specify card number or identifier, device number and subdevice number
(-1 means any).

To see the list of cards currently recognized by your system check the
files F</proc/asound/cards> and F</proc/asound/devices>.

For example to capture with B<ffmpeg> from an ALSA device with
card id 0, you may run the command:
	
	ffmpeg -f alsa -i hw:0 alsaout.wav


For more information see:
E<lt>B<http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/alsa-lib/pcm.html>E<gt>

=head2 avfoundation


AVFoundation input device.

AVFoundation is the currently recommended framework by Apple for streamgrabbing on OSX E<gt>= 10.7 as well as on iOS.
The older QTKit framework has been marked deprecated since OSX version 10.7.

The input filename has to be given in the following syntax:
	
	-i "[[VIDEO]:[AUDIO]]"

The first entry selects the video input while the latter selects the audio input.
The stream has to be specified by the device name or the device index as shown by the device list.
Alternatively, the video and/or audio input device can be chosen by index using the

    B<-video_device_index E<lt>INDEXE<gt>>

and/or

    B<-audio_device_index E<lt>INDEXE<gt>>

, overriding any
device name or index given in the input filename.

All available devices can be enumerated by using B<-list_devices true>, listing
all device names and corresponding indices.

There are two device name aliases:

=over 4



=item C<default>

Select the AVFoundation default device of the corresponding type.


=item C<none>

Do not record the corresponding media type.
This is equivalent to specifying an empty device name or index.


=back



=head3 Options


AVFoundation supports the following options:


=over 4

=head2 decklink


The decklink input device provides capture capabilities for Blackmagic
DeckLink devices.

To enable this input device, you need the Blackmagic DeckLink SDK and you
need to configure with the appropriate C<--extra-cflags>
and C<--extra-ldflags>.
On Windows, you need to run the IDL files through B<widl>.

DeckLink is very picky about the formats it supports. Pixel format is
uyvy422 or v210, framerate and video size must be determined for your device with
B<-list_formats 1>. Audio sample rate is always 48 kHz and the number
of channels can be 2, 8 or 16.


=head3 Options



=over 4



=item B<list_devices>

If set to B<true>, print a list of devices and exit.
Defaults to B<false>.


=item B<list_formats>

If set to B<true>, print a list of supported formats and exit.
Defaults to B<false>.


=item B<bm_v210>

If set to B<1>, video is captured in 10 bit v210 instead
of uyvy422. Not all Blackmagic devices support this option.

=back



=head2 dshow


Windows DirectShow input device.

DirectShow support is enabled when FFmpeg is built with the mingw-w64 project.
Currently only audio and video devices are supported.

Multiple devices may be opened as separate inputs, but they may also be
opened on the same input, which should improve synchronism between them.

The input name should be in the format:

	
	<TYPE>=<NAME>[:<TYPE>=<NAME>]


where I<TYPE> can be either I<audio> or I<video>,
and I<NAME> is the device's name or alternative name..


=head3 Options


If no options are specified, the device's defaults are used.
If the device does not support the requested options, it will
fail to open.

and configurations manually.
Note that for crossbar devices, adjusting values in this dialog
may be needed at times to toggle between PAL (25 fps) and NTSC (29.97)
input frame rates, sizes, interlacing, etc.  Changing these values can
enable different scan rates/frame rates and avoiding green bars at
the bottom, flickering scan lines, etc.
Note that with some devices, changing these properties can also affect future
invocations (sets new defaults) until system reboot occurs.


=item B<show_audio_device_dialog>

=head2 gdigrab


Win32 GDI-based screen capture device.

This device allows you to capture a region of the display on Windows.

There are two options for the input filename:
	
	desktop

or
	
	title=<window_title>


The first option will capture the entire desktop, or a fixed region of the
desktop. The second option will instead capture the contents of a single
window, regardless of its position on the screen.

For example, to grab the entire desktop using B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -f gdigrab -framerate 6 -i desktop out.mpg


Grab a 640x480 region at position C<10,20>:
	
	ffmpeg -f gdigrab -framerate 6 -offset_x 10 -offset_y 20 -video_size vga -i desktop out.mpg


Grab the contents of the window named "Calculator"
	
	ffmpeg -f gdigrab -framerate 6 -i title=Calculator out.mpg



=head3 Options



=over 4


=item B<draw_mouse>

Specify whether to draw the mouse pointer. Use the value C<0> to
not draw the pointer. Default value is C<1>.


=item B<framerate>

Set the grabbing frame rate. Default value is C<ntsc>,
corresponding to a frame rate of C<30000/1001>.


=item B<show_region>

Show grabbed region on screen.

If I<show_region> is specified with C<1>, then the grabbing
region will be indicated on screen. With this option, it is easy to
know what is being grabbed if only a portion of the screen is grabbed.

Note that I<show_region> is incompatible with grabbing the contents
of a single window.

For example:
	
	ffmpeg -f gdigrab -show_region 1 -framerate 6 -video_size cif -offset_x 10 -offset_y 20 -i desktop out.mpg



=item B<video_size>

Set the video frame size. The default is to capture the full screen if F<desktop> is selected, or the full window size if F<title=I<window_title>> is selected.


=item B<offset_x>

When capturing a region with I<video_size>, set the distance from the left edge of the screen or desktop.

Note that the offset calculation is from the top left corner of the primary monitor on Windows. If you have a monitor positioned to the left of your primary monitor, you will need to use a negative I<offset_x> value to move the region to that monitor.


=item B<offset_y>

When capturing a region with I<video_size>, set the distance from the top edge of the screen or desktop.

Note that the offset calculation is from the top left corner of the primary monitor on Windows. If you have a monitor positioned above your primary monitor, you will need to use a negative I<offset_y> value to move the region to that monitor.


=back



=head2 iec61883


FireWire DV/HDV input device using libiec61883.

To enable this input device, you need libiec61883, libraw1394 and
libavc1394 installed on your system. Use the configure option
C<--enable-libiec61883> to compile with the device enabled.

The iec61883 capture device supports capturing from a video device
connected via IEEE1394 (FireWire), using libiec61883 and the new Linux
FireWire stack (juju). This is the default DV/HDV input method in Linux
Kernel 2.6.37 and later, since the old FireWire stack was removed.

Specify the FireWire port to be used as input file, or "auto"
to choose the first port connected.


=head3 Options



=over 4



=item B<dvtype>

Override autodetection of DV/HDV. This should only be used if auto
detection does not work, or if usage of a different device type
should be prohibited. Treating a DV device as HDV (or vice versa) will
not work and result in undefined behavior.
The values B<auto>, B<dv> and B<hdv> are supported.


=item B<dvbuffer>

Set maximum size of buffer for incoming data, in frames. For DV, this
is an exact value. For HDV, it is not frame exact, since HDV does
not have a fixed frame size.


=item B<dvguid>

Select the capture device by specifying it's GUID. Capturing will only
be performed from the specified device and fails if no device with the
given GUID is found. This is useful to select the input if multiple
devices are connected at the same time.
Look at /sys/bus/firewire/devices to find out the GUIDs.


=back



=head3 Examples

=item *

Grab and show the input of a FireWire DV/HDV device.
	
	ffplay -f iec61883 -i auto



=item *

Grab and record the input of a FireWire DV/HDV device,
using a packet buffer of 100000 packets if the source is HDV.
	
	ffmpeg -f iec61883 -i auto -hdvbuffer 100000 out.mpg

=head2 jack


JACK input device.

To enable this input device during configuration you need libjack
installed on your system.

A JACK input device creates one or more JACK writable clients, one for
each audio channel, with name I<client_name>:input_I<N>, where
I<client_name> is the name provided by the application, and I<N>
is a number which identifies the channel.
Each writable client will send the acquired data to the FFmpeg input
device.

Once you have created one or more JACK readable clients, you need to
connect them to one or more JACK writable clients.

To connect or disconnect JACK clients you can use the B<jack_connect>
and B<jack_disconnect> programs, or do it through a graphical interface,
for example with B<qjackctl>.

To list the JACK clients and their properties you can invoke the command
B<jack_lsp>.

Follows an example which shows how to capture a JACK readable client
with B<ffmpeg>.
	
	# Create a JACK writable client with name "ffmpeg".
	$ ffmpeg -f jack -i ffmpeg -y out.wav
	
	# Start the sample jack_metro readable client.
	$ jack_metro -b 120 -d 0.2 -f 4000
	
	# List the current JACK clients.
	$ jack_lsp -c
	system:capture_1
	system:capture_2
	system:playback_1
	system:playback_2
	ffmpeg:input_1
	metro:120_bpm
	
	# Connect metro to the ffmpeg writable client.
	$ jack_connect metro:120_bpm ffmpeg:input_1

=head2 lavfi


Libavfilter input virtual device.

This input device reads data from the open output pads of a libavfilter
filtergraph.

For each filtergraph open output, the input device will create a
corresponding stream which is mapped to the generated output. Currently
only video data is supported. The filtergraph is specified through the
option B<graph>.


=head3 Options



=over 4



=item B<graph>

Specify the filtergraph to use as input. Each video open output must be
labelled by a unique string of the form "outI<N>", where I<N> is a
number starting from 0 corresponding to the mapped input stream
generated by the device.
The first unlabelled output is automatically assigned to the "out0"
label, but all the others need to be specified explicitly.

The suffix "+subcc" can be appended to the output label to create an extra
stream with the closed captions packets attached to that output
(experimental; only for EIA-608 / CEA-708 for now).
The subcc streams are created after all the normal streams, in the order of
the corresponding stream.
For example, if there is "out19+subcc", "out7+subcc" and up to "out42", the
stream #43 is subcc for stream #7 and stream #44 is subcc for stream #19.

If not specified defaults to the filename specified for the input
device.


=item B<graph_file>

Set the filename of the filtergraph to be read and sent to the other
filters. Syntax of the filtergraph is the same as the one specified by
the option I<graph>.


=item B<dumpgraph>

Dump graph to stderr.

As the previous example, but use filename for specifying the graph
description, and omit the "out0" label:
	
	ffplay -f lavfi color=c=pink



=item *

Create three different video test filtered sources and play them:
	
	ffplay -f lavfi -graph "testsrc [out0]; testsrc,hflip [out1]; testsrc,negate [out2]" test3



=item *

Read an audio stream from a file using the amovie source and play it
back with B<ffplay>:

=item B<speed>

Set drive reading speed. Default value is 0.

The speed is specified CD-ROM speed units. The speed is set through
the libcdio C<cdio_cddap_speed_set> function. On many CD-ROM
drives, specifying a value too large will result in using the fastest
speed.


=item B<paranoia_mode>

Set paranoia recovery mode flags. It accepts one of the following values:


=over 4


=item B<disable>


=item B<verify>

=head2 libdc1394


IIDC1394 input device, based on libdc1394 and libraw1394.

Requires the configure option C<--enable-libdc1394>.


=head2 openal


The OpenAL input device provides audio capture on all systems with a
working OpenAL 1.1 implementation.

To enable this input device during configuration, you need OpenAL
headers and libraries installed on your system, and need to configure
FFmpeg with C<--enable-openal>.

OpenAL headers and libraries should be provided as part of your OpenAL
implementation, or as an additional download (an SDK). Depending on your
installation you may need to specify additional flags via the
C<--extra-cflags> and C<--extra-ldflags> for allowing the build
system to locate the OpenAL headers and libraries.

An incomplete list of OpenAL implementations follows:


=over 4

=head2 video4linux2, v4l2


Video4Linux2 input video device.

"v4l2" can be used as alias for "video4linux2".

If FFmpeg is built with v4l-utils support (by using the
C<--enable-libv4l2> configure option), it is possible to use it with the
C<-use_libv4l2> input device option.

The name of the device to grab is a file device node, usually Linux
systems tend to automatically create such nodes when the device
(e.g. an USB webcam) is plugged into the system, and has a name of the
kind F</dev/videoI<N>>, where I<N> is a number associated to
the device.

Video4Linux2 devices usually support a limited set of
I<width>xI<height> sizes and frame rates. You can check which are
supported using B<-list_formats all> for Video4Linux2 devices.
Some devices, like TV cards, support one or more standards. It is possible
to list all the supported standards using B<-list_standards all>.

The time base for the timestamps is 1 microsecond. Depending on the kernel
version and configuration, the timestamps may be derived from the real time
clock (origin at the Unix Epoch) or the monotonic clock (origin usually at
boot time, unaffected by NTP or manual changes to the clock). The
B<-timestamps abs> or B<-ts abs> option can be used to force
conversion into the real time clock.

Some usage examples of the video4linux2 device with B<ffmpeg>
and B<ffplay>:

=head2 x11grab


X11 video input device.

To enable this input device during configuration you need libxcb
installed on your system. It will be automatically detected during
configuration.

Alternatively, the configure option B<--enable-x11grab> exists
for legacy Xlib users.

This device allows one to capture a region of an X11 display.

The filename passed as input has the syntax:
	
	[<hostname>]:<display_number>.<screen_number>[+<x_offset>,<y_offset>]


I<hostname>:I<display_number>.I<screen_number> specifies the
X11 display name of the screen to grab from. I<hostname> can be
omitted, and defaults to "localhost". The environment variable
B<DISPLAY> contains the default display name.

I<x_offset> and I<y_offset> specify the offsets of the grabbed
area with respect to the top-left border of the X11 screen. They
default to 0.

Check the X11 documentation (e.g. B<man X>) for more detailed
information.

Use the B<xdpyinfo> program for getting basic information about
the properties of your X11 display (e.g. grep for "name" or
"dimensions").

For example to grab from F<:0.0> using B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -f x11grab -framerate 25 -video_size cif -i :0.0 out.mpg


Grab at position C<10,20>:

C<centered> or a number of pixels I<PIXELS>.

When it is specified with "centered", the grabbing region follows the mouse
pointer and keeps the pointer at the center of region; otherwise, the region
follows only when the mouse pointer reaches within I<PIXELS> (greater than
zero) to the edge of region.

For example:
	
	ffmpeg -f x11grab -follow_mouse centered -framerate 25 -video_size cif -i :0.0 out.mpg


To follow only when the mouse pointer reaches within 100 pixels to edge:
	
	ffmpeg -f x11grab -follow_mouse 100 -framerate 25 -video_size cif -i :0.0 out.mpg



=item B<framerate>

Set the grabbing frame rate. Default value is C<ntsc>,
corresponding to a frame rate of C<30000/1001>.


=item B<show_region>

Show grabbed region on screen.

If I<show_region> is specified with C<1>, then the grabbing
region will be indicated on screen. With this option, it is easy to
know what is being grabbed if only a portion of the screen is grabbed.


=item B<region_border>

Set the region border thickness if B<-show_region 1> is used.
Range is 1 to 128 and default is 3 (XCB-based x11grab only).

For example:
	
	ffmpeg -f x11grab -show_region 1 -framerate 25 -video_size cif -i :0.0+10,20 out.mpg


With I<follow_mouse>:
	
	ffmpeg -f x11grab -follow_mouse centered -show_region 1 -framerate 25 -video_size cif -i :0.0 out.mpg

	-grab_x <x_offset> -grab_y <y_offset>


Set the grabbing region coordinates. They are expressed as offset from the top left
corner of the X11 window. The default value is 0.



=head1 OUTPUT DEVICES


Output devices are configured elements in FFmpeg that can write
multimedia data to an output device attached to your system.

When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported output devices
are enabled by default. You can list all available ones using the
configure option "--list-outdevs".

You can disable all the output devices using the configure option
"--disable-outdevs", and selectively enable an output device using the
option "--enable-outdev=I<OUTDEV>", or you can disable a particular
input device using the option "--disable-outdev=I<OUTDEV>".

List of output devices can be obtained with command B<pactl list sinks>.


=item B<buffer_size>


=item B<buffer_duration>

Control the size and duration of the PulseAudio buffer. A small buffer
gives more control, but requires more frequent updates.

B<buffer_size> specifies size in bytes while
B<buffer_duration> specifies duration in milliseconds.

When both options are provided then the highest value is used
(duration is recalculated to bytes using stream parameters). If they
are set to 0 (which is default), the device will use the default
PulseAudio duration value. By default PulseAudio set buffer duration
to around 2 seconds.


=item B<prebuf>

Specify pre-buffering size in bytes. The server does not start with
