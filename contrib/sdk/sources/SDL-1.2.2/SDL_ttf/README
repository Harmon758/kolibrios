This library is a wrapper around the excellent FreeType 1.2 library,
available at:
	http://www.freetype.org/

WARNING: There may be patent issues with using the FreeType library.
Check the FreeType website for up-to-date details.

This library allows you to use TrueType fonts to render text in SDL
applications.

To make the library, first install the FreeType library, then type
'make' to build the SDL truetype library and 'make all' to build
the demo application.

Be careful when including fonts with your application, as many of them
are copyrighted.  The Microsoft fonts, for example, are not freely 
redistributable and even the free "web" fonts they provide are only 
redistributable in their special executable installer form (May 1998).
There are plenty of freeware and shareware fonts available on the Internet
though, and may suit your purposes.

Please see the file "COPYING" for license information for this library.

Enjoy!
