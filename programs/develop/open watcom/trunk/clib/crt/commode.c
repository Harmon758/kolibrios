/*
 * __set_commode function is actually a _WCRTLINK function. It's prototyped
 * incorrectly so that this module will work correctly with both dynamic
 * and static versions of the C library.
 *
 * The pragma is there so that this module will work with both stack and
 * register calling conventions, eliminating the need to have a separate
 * object file for each.
 *
 * Similarly, __set_commode is declared _WCI86FAR so that the same object
 * file will work in any 16-bit memory model.
