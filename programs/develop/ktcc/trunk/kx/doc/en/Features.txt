
+ Library autoload
  Now you don't need to think about having to load dependent libraries.
  The most of this work will be done by TCC and Dll.obj

+ Easy linking using *.def files
  All you need to do is connect the files describing the symbols
  of the used libraries. This files have plain text format and may 
  easy created in any text editor. If one or more libraries use the same
  symbols you may use name prefix to solve symbols conflicts 
  No more complicated of creating *.o and/or *.a files
  
+ Reduced image size
  Since the library loader no longer needs to be placed in every application,
  this reduces the size of the image. No more C layer neded, all dependent
  libraries loading and also initialized automatically.
  The compact format of the import table is also used.
  
+ Backward compatible
  You don't need change your project. But the features described above will
  require reconfiguration. Once you have tried it, you do not want to come back.
