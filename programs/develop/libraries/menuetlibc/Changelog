21.02.2011 - CleverMouse
- fix compile for gcc4.1 and later

13.03.2010 - diamond (version 0.2.9)
- fix structure for sysfn 9
- mgcc options changed to size optimization
- stack size increased from 16K to 128K
- include files are compatible with VC now
- correct return status of linuxtools/*; make stops on error
- compatibility with gcc4
- compatibility with 64-bit host systems

28.08.2007 - vectoroc
- added:
  __menuet__debug_out_byte
  __menuet__debug_out
  __kolibri__cofflib_getproc
  __kolibri__cofflib_load
-  Now execution of any program starts at 'main' function (not 'app_main'!)

27.08.2007
- access() for root directory works now
- some bugfixes

05.03.2007
- Implemented fstat()
- fopen(...,"w") works as it must work
- malloc/realloc use dynamic memory when static one is over

23.02.2007
- Added: remove/unlink, ftruncate/chsize, stupid implementation of rename

xx.02.2007 - diamond (here and in the future)
- Modifications for KolibriOS
- Build on linux, cygwin, mingw

7.05.2004 (version 0.2.8)
- Many bugfixes
- SDL 1.2.7 fixes

18.04.2004
- Again bugfixes
- SDL 1.2.7

07.09.2003
- Removed dpmi.h and go32.h (they were wasting space)
- Moved libmcoff to main library distribution

05.09.2003
- Fixed bug in sbrk

17.08.2003 (version 0.2.6a)
- OS (Linux and DJGPP) independent compilation process
- Library can be extracted to any other directory than / (in Linux) or
  drive where DJGPP is (in DOS).
- MENUETDEV library tells where is library extracted (look @ README.first).

02.08.2003 (version 0.2.6)
- Fixed exit() and crt1.c (returning from app_main caused fault)
- Added transparent paths (so e.g. chdir("/hd/1/menuetos"); 
  f=fopen("../xyz","rb"); works)
- Fixed getcwd
- Fixed chdir
- Changed TODO
- SDL didn't have much bugs. C library was buggy and caused SDL to fault ;)
  Now most things work.

01.08.2003
- Fixed clock and date support so gettimeofday (and functions that use
  it work, too)
- Fixed some assembly code in menuetos support
- Changed assert and unimp to dump error to debug board
- Changed abort to dump error to debug board
- Added __libclog_printf and __libclog_vprintf functions which allow
  writing to debug board
- I've got libSDL,freetype,libSDLimage,libSDLdraw,libz,libjpg and libpng
  working ;) SDL needs more fixes and speedups (due to slow code in MenuetOS
  support. Ok, but it works.)

26.04.2003
- Bugfix in malloc
- Finally got filesystem working
- Fixed putimage function (arguments to interrupt were in wrong order)
- This is stable release !!!! (finally I got libjpeg working :)

25.12.2002
- Some bugfixes
- Added some math functions
- Networking stuff rewritten

28.11.2002
- Fixed and added some stuff
- New app: binary clock
- Removed all inport*,outport*,etc. since they are not needed, because
  Menuet will kill app which is trying to do I/O using, e.g. inb %dx,%al
- Ported libAVLTree,libmpeg,libjpeg,libelf (but they have to be downloaded
  separately).

15.11.2002
- Modifed compilation engine to better
  So there are many small makefiles instead of big one.
- Modified .s files and assembly blocks to declare (and call)
  symbols with or without underscores (depends on /menuetos/config.h)
- Added networking stuff (what Menuet supports now)

11.10.2002
- Fixed some lines in I/O stuff
- Modified fflush to flush file to disk
- Added support for syscalls: sound and direct screen access
- Final stable release 0.2.2

10.10.2002:
- Added DOS I/O stuff, so you can use fopen/fclose/fread/fwrite/etc. now !!! 
  (At last GCC and many other GNU tools can be ported !).
- Fixed some bugs
- Added command line argument support
- Added makefile for .a library and makefile for C++ applications
- Added some more examples

24.8.2002:
- Modified some src/libc/ansi/stdio/f*.c
- Ported libz and libpng

22.8.2002 :
- Modified to compile in Linux. You can't use DJGPP anymore.
- Created some linuxtools mgcc,mld,mgcc which execute gcc,ld and g++
  with specific parameters for applications.
- Moved console stuff to libcon.a not to mess code

??? - 
 I don't remember when I created it :))))
