Test KOS image features:
 - rev 8498
 - kernel unpacked (to run faster in qemu for windows)
 - kolibrios/ directory with lib/libc.dll (newlib) inside automatically mounts on start
 - DOCKY removed from autorun.dat (cuz its very annoying :D )
 - removed 3d, demos, games, fnav, kfm, animage, iconedit, etc. to get free space for things above
