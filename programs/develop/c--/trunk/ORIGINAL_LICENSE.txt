INTRO TO SPHINX C-- (updated 28 Oct 1996)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hello, and welcome to SPHINX C--.  C-- is a language I (Peter Cellik)
created, it is a half way point between C and Assembly.  The main thought
behind C-- is to create very small, and hopefully fast programs.  The output
efficiency is close to assembly with the source file being similar to C and
thus more readable than assembly source.  C-- can be used as a stand alone
language, or, via the use of Microsoft compatible OBJ output, be used within
another language such as C++ or Borland Pascal.

This is the final release of C--!  It has been over a year since I have made
any changes to C--, so I have decided its time to release it all to the
public domain.  I have enjoyed your responses over the years and I look
forward to more.  I have had replies from over 25 different countries.
Thank you everyone for saying hello.  Sorry if I did not reply, sometimes
there just isn't time.

The file is C--FINAL.ZIP.  It should contain the compiler, the examples and
also the source code.


REQUIREMENTS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    System Requirements:
    - 8086 or higher CPU computer
    - DOS 3.0 or greater
    - 512K RAM or greater
    - Keyboard (I should hope)
    - a hard drive will really speed things up, though C-- can even run off a
      floppy if you are not in a hurry
    - a mouse may assist navigation through the C-- Work Bench, but the
      keyboard can be used instead
    - some of the example files require VGA display, if you do not have VGA
      you are missing out on life

    Programmer Requirements (uh-oh):
    - Brain (a good one too)
    - Reasonable understanding of C or similar high level language
    - Some 8086 or higher assembly knowledge, the more the better

    
FILE LIST:
~~~~~~~~~~
The following files should be included in the C--C????.ZIP package:

.\C--      EXE   // The SPHINX C-- Compiler
.\C--      OVL   // File required by C--.EXE
.\WB       COM   // C-- Work Bench Driver
.\WB       EXE   // C-- Work Bench Main Program
.\C--INFO  DOC   // Info on the C-- Programming Language
.\C--ASM   DOC   // Info on C-- Inline Assembly Language
.\STAKPROC DOC   // Info on C-- stack procedures
.\REGPROCS DOC   // Info on C-- REG procedures and macros
.\WBHELP   DOC   // Info on using the C-- Work Bench
.\ALLPROCS DOC   // List of all stack and REG procedures and macros
.\???????? H--   // Some C-- header files
.\README   DOC   // This file your reading
.\examples\GUS\*.*       // Gravis Ultra Sound example programs
.\examples\OBJ\*.*       // OBJ file output example programs
.\examples\OTHER\*.*     // Misc. example programs
.\examples\ROCK\*.*      // VGA game example program
.\examples\SBLASTER\*.*  // Sound blaster example programs
.\examples\SIMPLE\*.*    // Small and simple example programs
.\examples\SYSTEM\*.*    // System detection example programs
.\examples\TSR\*.*       // Terminate and Stay Resident example programs
.\examples\VGA\*.*       // VGA example programs
.\examples\stuff\*.*     // some personal examples
.\examples\HISTORY.DOC   // Revision history of this example package
.\source\*.*           // Source for SPHINX C-- Compiler and Work Bench

NOTE:  I do not take credit (or blame) for EURO_MOD.EXE, it is supplied as a
       usefully utility which can be accessed via a C-- header file.  It is
       free and, as far as I understand, can be used and distributed by 
       anyone for anyone.



HOW TO START:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
UnZIP the C--FINAL.ZIP package using the '-d' option.

Next, set the 'C--' environmental variable to the full path of the directory
you unzipped into.  C-- uses the 'C--' environmental variable to find the
compiler, help files and include files.  For example, if you unzipped C--
into the directory 'C:\C--', then you would type:

	SET C--=C:\C--

You may wish to add the above line to your 'AUTOEXEC.BAT'.

You may then type WB at the DOS prompt to start the C-- Work Bench.  Take a 
look at some the *.C-- example files.  Press F3 to load and F5 to compile and 
run.

Be sure to be in the same directory as the source file(s) for the *.C-- file
may need to load some other files, such as palettes and bitmaps.  Use the
'Change Dir...' command in the 'File' menu to change directories.

After you get a taste of what it can do, take a look at the file 'C--INFO.DOC'
for information on how to program in C--.  'C--INFO.DOC' can be viewed in the
C-- Work Bench by pressing <SHIFT><F1> or selecting 'Main General Help' from
the 'Help' menu.


THE PRICE:
~~~~~~~~~~
This version of C-- is GREENWARE, and you are free to use it so long as you 
make an effort everyday to help out the environment.  A few ideas:
	- use only recycled computer paper
	- be sure to recycle the computer paper after you use it
	- use public transport
	- sell that 80 cylinder car of yours and buy a small 4 cylinder, or
	  better yet, buy a motorbike
	- support Green Peace
	- REDUCE-REUSE-recycle
	- stop smoking
	- ride a bike to work or school
	- don't buy products that are harmful to the environment
	- stop using weed killers on your lawn
	- support Friends of the Earth
	- recycle your cans
	- don't buy products that have lots of extra packaging
	- use a fax modem instead of a paper fax machine
	- reuse your plastic bags
	- (you get the idea)


DISCLAIMER:
~~~~~~~~~~~
I accept no responsibility for any damage or loss of time, hardware, sanity, 
software or data caused by this product or programs made with it.  So there!


FINAL NOTES:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Any programs you make with C-- you may do with as you wish.  I would greatly
appreciate any feedback you can give me.  Just say hello, or send me some
cool stuff.  Send me your comments, maybe even some code you have written,
I would like them very much.
