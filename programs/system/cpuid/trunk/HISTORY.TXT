;"To do" plans:
; actual use of Brand ID for description of Intel's CPU, i.e. Celeron/Pentium separation;
; remove support of Cyrix and early Centaur (IDT)  - they are too old, rare and non-standard;
; Sempron detection - probably they supports Brand-ID;
; update caches descriptors for intel Core 1/2
; quantity of logical CPU/cores - requires APIC ID analysis
; newest AMD/Intel codename detection

;Features:  
;          (+)  fixed address of LAHF feature, added detection of CMPL, SVM, MOVCR8 technologies for AMD; 
;          (+)  fixed L2 cache size detection for VIA (they changed format from 8 bits to 16 bits several years ago); 
;          (+)  more macroses for Interface and Threads (from Menuett.inc written by /^S0rG^\, 2002), sources separated into several include files;
;          (++) more info about caches for VIA and Transmeta;
;          (+)  added detection of DCA, SSSE3, VMX technologies for Intel;
;          (+)  updated multiplier detection for AMD and Intel (thanks a lot to Ghost);
;Known issues: Sempron marked as AthlonXP

;          (+)  new caches for Intel
;          (+)  fixed Celeron detection based on L2 cache size for newest Intel CPU (there are Celeron models with 512 Kb);
