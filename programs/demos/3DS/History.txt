View3ds 0.057 - April 2011.
1. By opening file bigger then ~18 KB, and choosing env mode program terminate.
   I remove this bug
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

View3ds 0.056 - February 2011.
1. MMX optimizations in 2tex mode (file two_tex.inc).
2. Tiny SSE optimizations (file BUMP_CAT.INC).
3. Bit (two instructions) improved random light generation procedure.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

View3ds 0.055 - January 2011.
1. SSE optimizations (file BUMP_TEX.INC).
2. Compiles correctly in newest FASM.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

View3ds 0.054 - December 2009 (Updated January 2010).
1. Skinned window by Leency.
2. Optimizations.
3. Re map texture, bumps option - allow spherical mapping around each axle (X,Y,Z).
4. Problem with too small memory to generate object fixed. (Problem ocurred with
   house.3ds object and others objects contains less than 1000 faces and points).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

View3ds 0.053 - (?) 2009
1. Optimizations.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

View3ds 0.052 - November 2007.
1. Memory for file is allocated dynamically.
2. Optimizations.
Note: compiling correct only for KolibriOS.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

View3ds 0.051 - October 2007.
1. More smooth texture mapping in tex and txgr shading model and others based on
   tex3.inc, tex_cat.inc shading models.
2. Predefined three, I hope, nice lights.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

View3ds 0.05 - (?) 2007
1. New shading model: cubic environment mapping with 1.5 kb light buffer.
2. Bumps optionally according to texture. ( It gives so called texture with
   shifts in bumps + texture shading model. )
3. Bumps depth button.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

View3ds 0.04 - March 2007.
1. New shading model: bump + texture.  Only version with z coordinate
   interpolation.
2. SSE optimizations ( files: two_tex.inc and bump_tex.inc )
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

View3ds 0.03 - March 2007.
1. Two shading models: smooth + texture, spherical environment mapping + texture.
   Version only with z coordinate interpolation.
2. Bit changed rotary. I took attempt in SSE instuctions. ( matrix multiplication )
3. Color position depend drawing model  instead spot light ( I hope,spot light come
   back in future ).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

View3ds 0.02 - December 2006.
1. New shading models - "spot" - spot light (only one, it's very CPU hungry model,
   and there is no easy way to implement buffer) with light attenuation (In my
   implmentation works not perfect); "dots" - app draws only points (with no culling).
2. Some loseless operations "mirror": according to each axis, rotary 90 degrees.
3. Postprocesing efects: Emboss (use blur to make edges more visable), fire ( be
   carefull during `fire + embos`parallel using).
4. "Move" -  Changes meaning of 'add vector' buttons:
   used "obj"  move  object, "camr" move camera (in this option use culling = 'off'
   I must make culling procedure bit advanced).
5. Generate button. Few objects generating (with bad normals)
6. Some optimizations on MMX.
7. I took an attempt to memory managing functions, but it decreased speed (no aligned
   memory in Menuet functions?)

There is really much work to do and I see disorder in app code.
Greetings for all, especially Madis Kalme for .3ds files support and good vibrations.  ;)
Merry Christmas and happy new year.

App View3ds ver 0.01 - November 2006.
1. Object generating (for now only one). When no parameter specified or error occured
   during reading file from disk, app generate object. No teapot.3ds needed on ramdrive,
   but, if this file exist it would be read as default.
2. Bug in read_from_file procedure fixed. (In  May, when I made shading light vector
   depend, I demaged bit Madis' procedure.)
3. Backface culling on/off option. (Some objects need culling off - they have mismatched
   normal vectors. Example: iron.3ds, sink.3ds, the generated one.)
4. Random lights procedure.
5. Spherical (instead old - planar ) bump, texture mapping.
6. Bit improved menu.
7. Blur.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

App "View3ds" - it's very early, still unfinished version but I want show you it.
Based on earlier demos.
1. 3ds object import as a parameter ( for now only short names supported )
   I updated Kfar app - it can run view3ds with parameter. You must copy it on
   ramdrive. You could do such funny thing: Run updated Kfar in KolbrInWin,
   before them set in KolInWin.ini file path to ramdrive, where yo have "view3ds",
   choose 3ds file ... Emulator will run View3ds with selected file.
   If no parameter specified, app try open tpot.3ds from ramdrive. If tpot.3ds
   don't exist on rd, app hang.
2. Many lights. Every light - unlinear model ( Phong illumination ). For now
   no light setting option.
3. Light buffer for grd, flat model.
