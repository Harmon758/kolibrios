  Build Instructions for Framebuffer NetSurf                  13 February 2010
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This document provides instructions for building the Framebuffer version of 
  NetSurf and provides guidance on obtaining NetSurf's build dependencies.

  Framebuffer NetSurf has been tested on Ubuntu and Debian.

  Building and executing NetSurf
================================

  First of all, you should examine the contents of Makefile.defaults
  and enable and disable relevant features as you see fit in a
  Makefile.config file.  Some of these options can be automatically
  detected and used, and where this is the case they are set to such.
  Others cannot be automatically detected from the Makefile, so you
  will either need to install the dependencies, or set them to NO.
  
  You should then obtain NetSurf's dependencies, keeping in mind which options
  you have enabled in the configuration file.  See the "Obtaining NetSurf's
  dependencies" section for specifics.
  
  Once done, to build Framebuffer NetSurf on a UNIX-like platform, simply run:

      $ make TARGET=framebuffer

  If that produces errors, you probably don't have some of NetSurf's build
  dependencies installed. See "Obtaining NetSurf's dependencies" below.
  Or turn off the complaining features in your Makefile.config.  You may
  need to "make clean" before attempting to build after installing the 
  dependencies.

  Run NetSurf by executing the "nsfb" program:

      $ ./nsfb

  | Note: NetSurf uses certain resources at run time.  In order to find these
  |       resources, it searches three locations:
  |
  |           1. ~/.netsurf/
  |           2. $NETSURFRES/
  |           3. /usr/share/netsurf/
  |
  |       In the build tree, the resources are located at
  |
  |           framebuffer/res
  |
  |       Setting $NETSURFRES to point at the resources in the build tree
  |       will enable you to run NetSurf from here without installation.
  |       To do this, run:
  |
  |           export NETSURFRES=`pwd`/framebuffer/res


  Fonts
=======

  The framebuffer port currently has two choices for font
  handling. The font handler may be selected at compile time by using
  the NETSURF_FB_FONTLIB configuration key. Currently supported values
  are internal and freetype

  Internal
----------

  The internal font system has a single built in monospaced face with
  CP467 encoding. The internal font plotter requires no additional
  resources and is very fast, it is also aesthetically unappealing.

  Freetype
----------

  The freetype font system (freetype version 2 API is used) has
  support for a number of different font file formats and faces. The
  framebuffer font handler takes advantage of the freetype library
  caching system to give good performance. 

  The font glyphs are, by default, rendered as 256 level transparency
  which gives excellent visual results even on small font sizes.

  The default font is the DejaVu trutype font set. The default path they
  are sourced from is /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-dejavu/ . 

  The compiled in default paths may be altered by setting values in
  the user configuration makefile Makefile.config. These values must
  be set to teh absolute path of the relevant font file including its
  .ttf extension. The variables are:

  NETSURF_FB_FONT_SANS_SERIF
  NETSURF_FB_FONT_SANS_SERIF_BOLD
  NETSURF_FB_FONT_SANS_SERIF_ITALIC
  NETSURF_FB_FONT_SANS_SERIF_ITALIC_BOLD
  NETSURF_FB_FONT_SERIF
  NETSURF_FB_FONT_SERIF_BOLD
  NETSURF_FB_FONT_MONOSPACE
  NETSURF_FB_FONT_MONOSPACE_BOLD
  NETSURF_FB_FONT_CURSIVE
  NETSURF_FB_FONT_FANTASY
  
  The font selection may be changed by placing truetype font files
  in the resources path. The resource files will be the generic names
  sans_serif.ttf, sans_serif_bold.ttf etc. 

  The font system is configured at runtime by several options. The
  fb_font_monochrome option causes the renderer to use monochrome
  glyph rendering which is faster to plot but slower to render and
  much less visually appealing. 

  The remaining seven options control the files to be used for font faces.

  fb_face_sans_serif - The sans serif face
  fb_face_sans_serif_bold - The bold sans serif face
  fb_face_sans_serif_italic - The italic sans serif face
  fb_face_sans_serif_italic_bold - The bold italic sans serif face.
  fb_face_serif - The serif font
  fb_serif_bold - The bold serif font
  fb_face_monospace - The monospaced font
  fb_face_monospace_bold - The bold monospaced font
  fb_face_cursive - The cursive font
  fb_face_fantasy - The fantasy font

  Old Freetype
--------------

  The framebuffer port Freetype font implementation was constructed
  using a modern version of the library (2.3.5) to use versions 2.2.1
  and prior the following patch is necessary.

  Selecting a frontend and appropriate options  
==============================================  

  The framebuffer port interfaces to its input and output devices
  using the NetSurf Framebuffer library (libnsfb). This library
  provides an abstraction layer to input and output devices.

  The surface used by libnsfb is selected by using the -f switch to
  NetSurf when executed. A surface in this context is simply the
  combination of input and output devices.

  A surface output device may be any linearly mapped area of
  memory. The framebuffer may be treated as values at 32, 16 or 8 bits
  per pixel. The input device is typically selected to complement the
  output device and is completely specific to the surface.

  There are several configuration options which may influence the
  framebuffer surfaces. These are:

    fb_refresh - The refresh rate (for physical displays)
    fb_depth - The depth (in bits per pixel) of the framebuffer
    window_width - The width of the framebuffer
    window_height - The height of the framebuffer

  The defaults are for 800 by 600 pixels at 16bpp and 70Hz refresh rate.

  The documentation of libnsfb should be consulted for futher
  information about supported frontends and their configuration.


  Obtaining NetSurf's build dependencies
========================================

  Many of NetSurf's dependencies are packaged on various operating systems.
  The remainder must be installed manually.  Currently, some of the libraries
  developed as part of the NetSurf project have not had official releases.
  Hopefully they will soon be released with downloadable tarballs and packaged
  in common distros.  For now, you'll have to make do with Git checkouts.

  Package installation
----------------------

  Debian-like OS:

      $ apt-get install libcurl3-dev libmng-dev 

  Recent OS versions might need libcurl4-dev instead of libcurl3-dev but
  note that when it has not been built with OpenSSL, the SSL_CTX is not
  available and results that certification details won't be presented in case
  they are invalid.  But as this is currently unimplemented in the Framebuffer
  flavour of NetSurf, this won't make a difference at all.

  Fedora:

      $ yum install curl-devel libmng-devel lcms-devel

  Other:

  You'll need to install the development resources for libcurl3 and libmng.

  Note that if you don't require MNG or JNG image support, NetSurf can be
  configured to use libpng instead of libmng. If you wish to do this, install
  the libpng development package instead.

  The NetSurf project's libraries
---------------------------------

  The NetSurf project has developed several libraries which are required by
  the browser. These are:

  LibParserUtils  --  Parser building utility functions
  LibWapcaplet    --  String internment
  Hubbub          --  HTML5 compliant HTML parser
  LibCSS          --  CSS parser and selection engine
  LibNSGIF        --  GIF format image decoder
  LibNSBMP        --  BMP and ICO format image decoder
  LibROSprite     --  RISC OS Sprite format image decoder
  LibNSFB         --  Framebuffer abstraction

  To fetch each of these libraries, run the appropriate commands from the
  Docs/LIBRARIES file.

  To build and install these libraries, simply enter each of their directories
  and run:
  
      $ sudo make install

  | Note: We advise enabling iconv() support in libparserutils, which vastly
  |       increases the number of supported character sets.  To do this,
  |       create a file called Makefile.config.override in the libparserutils
  |       directory, containing the following line:
  |
  |           CFLAGS += -DWITH_ICONV_FILTER
  |
  |       For more information, consult the libparserutils README file.

  General requirements
----------------------

  Depending on the frontend selected the build may need specific
  libraries installed, e.g. the SDL port requires SDL1.2 or later

  Installing these libraries will often will pull in loads of things,
  like the PNG and JPEG libraries, colour management libraries, zlib,
  OpenSSL etc that NetSurf also depends on.
