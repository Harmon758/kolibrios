  Build Instructions for AmigaOS NetSurf                      13 February 2010
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This document provides instructions for building the AmigaOS version of
  NetSurf and provides guidance on obtaining NetSurf's build dependencies.

  AmigaOS NetSurf has been tested on AmigaOS 4.0 July 2007 Update and AmigaOS
  4.1.  It will require modification for AmigaOS 3.9 or earlier, or other
  Amiga-like platforms.

  AmigaOS NetSurf will build against newlib by default, building against
  clib2 has not been tested.


  Building and executing NetSurf
================================

  First of all, you should examine the contents of Makefile.defaults
  and enable and disable relevant features as you see fit by creating
  a Makefile.config.  Some of these options can be automatically
  detected and used, although it is better to explicitly enable or
  disable options.
  
  You should then obtain NetSurf's dependencies, keeping in mind which options
  you have enabled in the configuration file.  See the next section for
  specifics.
  
  Once done, to build AmigaOS NetSurf on OS4, simply run:

      1> gmake

  If that produces errors, you probably don't have some of NetSurf's build
  dependencies installed. See "Obtaining NetSurf's dependencies" below, or turn
  off the complaining features in a Makefile.config.

  Running NetSurf from the build tree requires some setup:

      1> makelink resources amiga/resources force
      1> copy amiga/resources/themes/default/NetSurf.info NetSurf.info

  It should then be possible to run NetSurf by executing NetSurf from the
  Shell or by double-clicking on the icon.


  Obtaining NetSurf's build dependencies
========================================

  Many of NetSurf's dependencies are included with the OS4 SDK or available
  from Aminet or OS4Depot.  The remainder must be built manually.

  The NetSurf project's libraries
---------------------------------

  The NetSurf project has developed several libraries which are required by
  the browser.  To fetch each of these libraries, run the appropriate commands
  from the Docs/LIBRARIES file.

  To build and install these libraries, simply enter each of their directories
  and run:
  
      1> gmake install

  | Note: We advise enabling iconv() support in libparserutils, which vastly
  |       increases the number of supported character sets.  To do this,
  |       create a file called Makefile.config.override in the libparserutils
  |       directory, containing the following lines:
  |
  |           CFLAGS += -DWITH_ICONV_FILTER
  |           LDFLAGS += -liconv
  |
  |       This requires libiconv as iconv support in newlib.library is buggy.
  |
  |       For more information, consult the libparserutils README file.

  | Note: Building libsvgtiny requires gperf, which is available from Aminet:
  |
  |           http://www.aminet.net/package/dev/c/gperf


  cURL
------

  A version of libcurl built for newlib is available from Aminet

      http://www.aminet.net/package/dev/lib/libcurl

  There is a shared object version included with some OWB releases.  To use
  this when compiling with Cairo support, a link must be made:

      1> makelink sdk:local/newlib/lib/libcurl.so sobjs:libcurl-7.16.so soft


  libmng
--------

  NetSurf uses libMNG to display MNG and PNG files.
  It builds without any problems on OS4, or available from Aminet:

      http://www.aminet.net/package/dev/lib/libmng_so


  OpenSSL
---------

  NetSurf uses OpenSSL for encrypted transfers.

      http://www.os4depot.net/share/development/library/misc/libopenssl.lha

  There is a shared object version included with some OWB releases.  To use
  this when compiling with Cairo support, a link must be made:

      1> makelink sdk:local/newlib/lib/libssl.so sobjs:libssl-0.9.8.so soft
      1> makelink sdk:local/newlib/lib/libcrypto.so sobjs:libssl-0.9.8.so soft


  Libharu
---------

  NetSurf can use Haru PDF to enable PDF export.  Haru PDF can be obtained
  from http://libharu.org/.  We require libharu 2.2 or later.

  | Note: libharu cannot be auto-detected by the Makefile.  If you wish to
  |       enable it, do so by creating a Makefile.config file.


  libregex
----------

  A version of the regular expression library can be obtained from Aminet:

      http://www.aminet.net/package/dev/lib/libregex-4.4.3


  openurl.library
-----------------

  The AmigaOS mailto: URL support uses openurl.library, this and the includes
  can be obtained from Aminet:

      http://www.aminet.net/package/comm/www/OpenURL-OS4


  General requirements
----------------------

  SDK:newlib/include/strings.h needs to be modified by adding the following:

      extern int strcasecmp(const char *, const char *);
      extern int strncasecmp(const char *, const char *, size_t);

  amiga/version.c is generated by version.rexx using the SVN command.  If
  the source has not been checked out from SVN, or is being cross-compiled,
  this file will need to be created by hand.  See the end of version.rexx
  for the variables that are defined in the file.

  Please note that building with Cairo (option NETSURF_AMIGA_USE_CAIRO) will
  link NetSurf against shared objects, and require the OS4.1 SDK to build and
  AmigaOS 4.1 to run.
