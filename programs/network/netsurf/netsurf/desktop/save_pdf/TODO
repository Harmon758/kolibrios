- finish all graphic primitives
- allow adding raw bitmaps
- make image-aware (embed the image in its native/original type if possible)

- adjust content width to page width
- divide output into multiple pages (not just the first one)
- rearrange file structure

- separate print-plotting as much as possible from window redrawing
- add text-scaling (if not yet using the original font - make the default one
	have the same width)
- add a save file.. dialogue
- add utf support to Haru ( doable? )
- wait for browser to end fetching?
- analyze and deal with performance issues(huge file hangs some pdf viewers,
	for example kpdf when viewing plotted http://www.onet.pl)
- deal with to wide pages - when window layouting adds a horizontal scrollbar,
	we should treat it otherwise - either print horizontal or scale or,
	better, find a new layout.
