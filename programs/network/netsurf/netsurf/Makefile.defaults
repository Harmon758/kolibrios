# NetSurf default build setup
#
#
# | WARNING: You should NOT be editing this file.
# |
# |          If you want to configure your build, create a 'Makefile.config'
# |          file with 'override' statements to override the settings here.
# |          Follow the example in 'Makefile.config.example'.
#
#
# This file should be treated as INVIOLATE and only altered to alter
# the defaults by a core developer. If you wish to configure the build
# of NetSurf then instead please create a file called Makefile.config
# and simply override the statements you require in that.  Remember
# that Makefile.config cannot override the TARGET. That must be set on
# the commandline. i.e. 'make TARGET=framebuffer' However
# Makefile.config can use the TARGET variable to control what to set
# the configuration options to.
#
# Some of these options support an 'AUTO' option, as well as YES and NO.
# When an option is set to AUTO, the Makefile will attempt to detect if that
# feature is available, enabling it if possible.
#
# Options marked "highly recommended" have a severe impact on NetSurf's
# use as a web browser and should be set to YES unless there is a particularly
# good reason not to.

$(error Makefile.defaults has been double-included.  If you did something utterly brain-dead such as copying Makefile.defaults to Makefile.config then you deserve all the pain you can imagine.
