## Building from sources

If you want to build game from sources, you have to install GCC (Linux) and MinGW (Windows).

* KolibriOS
You have to install menuetlibc: see "Compilers GCC, G++." section at diamond.kolibrios.org/hll/hll_eng.htm.
To build a binary file for KolibriOS under Linux type in a terminal:

    make

Binary file would appear in current directory.

* Linux
To build a Linux binary file:

    make -f Makefile.linux

Binary files would appear in bin directory.

* Windows
To build a Windows binary file you have to install MinGW (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/) with mingw32-base, mingw32-gcc and mingw-gcc-g++ packages.
Don't forget to add a path to a folder containing MinGW binary files to the Path environment variable ("C:\MinGW\bin" for me).

  * If you don't have MSYS installed:

      mingw32-make -f Makefile.win

  * If you have MSYS installed:
      
      make -f Makefile.linux
      
Binary files would appear in bin directory.

Have fun!
