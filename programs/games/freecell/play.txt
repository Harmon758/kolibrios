FreeCell. 

You can find this games in Windows XP and Linux Mandrake 9.0 distributions.

Rules to FreeCell can be found in help files for those games but I place here
game rules from site www.freecell.org:

4 cells (top left) - storage locations for cards. 
Only 1 card allowed in each cell.  
	
8 tableau piles (below foundations and cells) - build down by alternate color.
Move groups of cards if they are in sequence down by alternate color and if 
there are enough free cells that the cards could be moved individually. 
Spaces can be filled by any card or legal group of cards (see KingOnly for 
option). At the start of the game 7 cards are dealt face up to the leftmost 4 
piles, 6 cards are dealt face up to the remaining piles.

Some features not implemented yet: moving groups of cards - you 
can move only one card at one time, no automatic moving of 
some cards in home.


You only need to copy the file freecell to the floppy; The rest of the
files are for assembling the code.
