*qsort(base, num, wid, comp) - quicksort function for sorting arrays
*
*Purpose:
*   quicksort the array of elements
*   side effects:  sorts in place
*   maximum array size is number of elements times size of elements,
*   but is limited by the virtual address space of the processor
*
*Entry:
*   char *base = pointer to base of array
*   unsigned num  = number of elements in the array
*   unsigned width = width in bytes of each array element
*   int (*comp)() = pointer to function returning analog of strcmp for
*           strings, but supplied by user for comparing the array elements.
*           it accepts 2 pointers to elements.
*           Returns neg if 1<2, 0 if 1=2, pos if 1>2.
*
*Exit:
*   returns void
