          ----------INTRODUCTION TO THE GAME----------


     THE ORGANIAN PEACE TREATY HAS COLLAPSED, AND THE FEDERATION
 IS AT WAR WITH THE KLINGON EMPIRE.  JOINING THE KLINGONS AGAINST
 THE FEDERATION ARE THE MEMBERS OF THE "ROMULAN STAR EMPIRE".  AS
 COMMANDER OF THE STARSHIP U. S. S. ENTERPRISE, YOUR JOB IS TO WIPE
 OUT THE KLINGON INVASION FLEET AND MAKE THE GALAXY SAFE FOR
 DEMOCRACY.

     YOUR BATTLEGROUND IS THE ENTIRE GALAXY, WHICH FOR CONVENIENCE
 IS DIVIDED UP INTO EIGHT ROWS OF EIGHT QUADRANTS EACH, LIKE A
 CHECKERBOARD.  ROWS ARE NUMBERED FROM TOP TO BOTTOM, AND COLUMNS
 ARE NUMBERED LEFT TO RIGHT, SO QUADRANT 1 - 8 WOULD BE IN THE
 UPPER RIGHT HAND CORNER OF THE GALAXY.

     DURING BATTLE YOU WILL BE CONCERNED ONLY WITH THOSE ENEMIES
 THAT OCCUPY THE SAME QUADRANT AS YOURSELF.  QUADRANTS ARE DIVIDED
 UP INTO SECTORS:  TEN ROWS OF TEN SECTORS EACH.  SECTORS ARE
 NUMBERED IN THE SAME WAY AS QUADRANTS, SO THE SECTOR IN THE UPPER
 RIGHT CORNER IS SECTOR 1 - 10.  YOU HAVE A SHORT-RANGE SCANNER
 WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO LOOK AT THE ENTIRE QUADRANT IN A SINGLE
 DISPLAY.

     ENEMIES RECHARGE DURING YOUR ABSENCE.  IF YOU LEAVE A QUADRANT
 CONTAINING A WEAKENED ENEMY, WHEN YOU RETURN TO THAT QUADRANT HE
 WILL BE STRONG AGAIN.  ALSO, EACH TIME YOU ENTER A QUADRANT, THE
 POSITIONS OF EVERYTHING IN THE QUADRANT (EXCEPT YOUR SHIP) ARE
 RANDOMIZED, TO SAVE YOU THE TROUBLE OF TRYING TO REMEMBER WHERE
 EVERYTHING IN THE QUADRANT IS.  NOTICE THAT THIS REFERS ONLY TO
 THE POSITIONS OF THINGS IN THE QUADRANT--THE NUMBERS OF EACH KIND
 OF THING ARE NOT CHANGED.  IF YOU KILL SOMETHING, IT STAYS DEAD.

     THE ROMULANS ARE NOT AS SERIOUS A THREAT TO THE FEDERATION
 AS THE KLINGONS.  FOR ONE THING, THERE ARE NOT AS MANY OF THEM.
 FOR ANOTHER, THE ROMULANS ARE NOT AS TREACHEROUS.  HOWEVER, ROMULANS
 ARE NOT TO BE TRIFLED WITH, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE IN VIOLATION
 OF THE "ROMULAN NEUTRAL ZONE".

     THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF KLINGONS:  ORDINARY KLINGONS, WHICH
 ARE BAD ENOUGH, AND KLINGON COMMANDERS, WHICH ARE EVEN WORSE.
 COMMANDERS ARE ABOUT THREE TIMES STRONGER THAN ORDINARY KLINGONS.
 COMMANDERS ARE MORE RESISTANT TO YOUR WEAPONS.  COMMANDERS CAN
 MOVE ABOUT DURING BATTLE, WHILE ORDINARY KLINGONS STAY PUT.  AND
 FINALLY, COMMANDERS HAVE A THING CALLED A "LONG-RANGE TRACTOR
 BEAM" WHICH THEY CAN USE, AT RANDOM INTERVALS, TO YANK YOU AWAY
 FROM WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND INTO THEIR QUADRANT, TO DO BATTLE WITH
 THEM.  THERE IS ALSO A SPECIAL COMMANDER, CALLED THE "SUPER-COMMANDER".
 THIS CHARACTER IS SO BAD, HE IS RESERVED FOR THE GOOD, EXPERT AND
 EMERITUS GAMES.  FORTUNATELY, THERE IS JUST ONE "SUPER-COMMANDER"
 IN A GAME.  IN ADDITION TO THE UNDESIRABLE TRAITS OF COMMANDERS, HE
 CAN MOVE FROM QUADRANT TO QUADRANT AT WILL, SEEKING OUT AND DESTROYING
 YOUR STARBASES, AND ANY HELPFUL PLANETS HE RUNS ACROSS.  HE ALSO HAS
 A SPY PLANTED ABOARD YOUR SHIP, GIVING HIM VALUABLE INFORMATION
 ABOUT YOUR CONDITION.  USING THIS INFORMATION, HE CAN DO DASTARDLY
 THINGS LIKE TRACTOR BEAM YOUR SHIP WHEN YOU ARE IN BAD SHAPE.  AND
 ONCE YOU'VE BEEN TRACTOR BEAMED BY THE "SUPER-COMMANDER" - - - 

                                                                        2
     BUT THE ADVANTAGES ARE NOT ALL ON THE SIDE OF THE ENEMY.
 YOUR SHIP IS MORE POWERFUL, AND HAS BETTER WEAPONS.  BESIDES,
 IN THIS GALAXY THERE ARE FROM TWO TO FIVE STARBASES, AT WHICH
 YOU CAN STOP TO REFUEL AND LICK YOUR WOUNDS, SAFE FROM ATTACK
 OR TRACTOR BEAMS.  BUT YOU HAD BEST NOT DALLY THERE TOO LONG,
 SINCE TIME IS NOT ON YOUR SIDE.  THE KLINGONS ARE NOT JUST AFTER
 YOU; THEY ARE ATTACKING THE ENTIRE FEDERATION.  THERE IS ALWAYS
 A FINITE "TIME LEFT", WHICH IS HOW MUCH LONGER THE FEDERATION CAN
 HOLD OUT IF YOU JUST SIT ON YOUR FAT BEHIND AND DO NOTHING.  AS
 YOU WIPE OUT KLINGONS, YOU REDUCE THE RATE AT WHICH THE INVASION
 FLEET WEAKENS THE FEDERATION, AND SO THE "TIME LEFT" UNTIL
 THE FEDERATION COLLAPSES MAY ACTUALLY INCREASE.  SINCE KLINGONS
 ARE THE MAIN THREAT TO THE FEDERATION, THE ROMULANS DO NOT FIGURE
 INTO THE "TIME LEFT".  IN FACT, YOU NEED NOT KILL ALL THE ROMULANS
 TO WIN.  IF YOU CAN GET ALL THE KLINGONS, THE FEDERATION WILL
 ABIDE FOREVER, AND YOU HAVE WON THE GAME.

     SPACE IS VAST, AND IT TAKES PRECIOUS TIME TO MOVE FROM ONE
 PLACE TO ANOTHER.  IN COMPARISON, OTHER THINGS HAPPEN SO QUICKLY
 THAT WE ASSUME THEY TAKE NO TIME AT ALL.  TWO WAYS THAT TIME
 CAN PASS ARE WHEN YOU MOVE, OR WHEN YOU ISSUE A COMMAND TO SIT
 STILL AND REST FOR A PERIOD OF TIME.  YOU WILL SOMETIMES WANT
 TO DO THE LATTER, SINCE THE VARIOUS DEVICES ABOARD YOUR STARSHIP
 MAY BE DAMAGED AND REQUIRE TIME TO REPAIR.  OF COURSE, REPAIRS
 CAN BE MADE MORE QUICKLY AT A STARBASE THAN THEY CAN IN FLIGHT.

     IN ADDITION TO KLINGONS, ROMULANS  AND STARBASES, THE GALAXY
 CONTAINS (SURPRISE) STARS.  MOSTLY, STARS ARE A NUISANCE AND
 JUST GET IN YOUR WAY.  YOU CAN TRIGGER A STAR INTO GOING NOVA
 BY SHOOTING ONE OF YOUR PHOTON TORPEDOES AT IT.  WHEN A STAR
 NOVAS, IT DOES A LOT OF DAMAGE TO ANYTHING IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT
 TO IT.  IF ANOTHER STAR IS ADJACENT TO A NOVA, IT TOO WILL GO
 NOVA.  STARS MAY ALSO OCCASIONALLY GO SUPERNOVA; A SUPERNOVA
 IN A QUADRANT DESTROYS EVERYTHING IN THE QUADRANT AND MAKES
 THE QUADRANT PERMANENTLY UNINHABITABLE.  YOU MAY "JUMP OVER" A
 QUADRANT CONTAINING A SUPERNOVA WHEN YOU MOVE, BUT YOU SHOULD
 NOT STOP THERE.

     SUPERNOVAS MAY HAPPEN SPONTANEOUSLY, WITHOUT PROVOCATION.  IF
 A SUPERNOVA OCCURS IN THE SAME QUADRANT YOU ARE IN, YOUR STARSHIP
 HAS AN "EMERGENCY AUTOMATIC OVERRIDE" WHICH PICKS SOME RANDOM
 DIRECTION AND SOME RANDOM WARP FACTOR, AND TRIES TO THROW YOU
 CLEAR OF THE SUPERNOVA.  IF THE SUPERNOVA OCCURS IN SOME OTHER
 QUADRANT, YOU JUST GET A WARNING MESSAGE FROM STARFLEET ABOUT IT
 (PROVIDED, OF COURSE, THAT YOUR SUBSPACE RADIO IS WORKING).

     ALSO A FEW PLANETS ARE SCATTERED THROUGH THE GALAXY.  THESE
 CAN SOMETIMES BE A GREAT HELP SINCE SOME OF THEM WILL HAVE
 "DILITHIUM CRYSTALS", WHICH ARE CAPABLE OF REPLENISHING THE
 SHIP'S ENERGY SUPPLY.  YOU CAN EITHER BEAM DOWN TO THE PLANET
 SURFACE USING THE TRANSPORTER, OR TAKE THE SHUTTLE CRAFT "GALILEO".

                                                                        3
     STAR TREK IS A RICH GAME, FULL OF DETAIL.  THESE INSTRUCTIONS
 ARE WRITTEN AT A MODERATE LEVEL--NO ATTEMPT HAS BEEN MADE FULLY
 TO DESCRIBE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE GAME, BUT THERE IS QUITE A BIT
 MORE HERE THAN YOU NEED TO GET STARTED.  IF YOU ARE NEW TO THE
 GAME, JUST GET A ROUGH IDEA OF THE KINDS OF COMMANDS AVAILABLE,
 AND START PLAYING.  AFTER A GAME OR TWO YOU WILL HAVE LEARNED
 EVERYTHING IMPORTANT, AND THE DETAILED COMMAND DESCRIPTIONS WHICH
 FOLLOW WILL BE A LOT MORE MEANINGFUL TO YOU.

     YOU HAVE WEAPONS:  PHASERS AND PHOTON TORPEDOES.  YOU HAVE
 A DEFENSE:  DEFLECTOR SHIELDS.  YOU CAN LOOK AT THINGS:  LONG-
 RANGE SCANNERS, SHORT-RANGE SCANNERS, AND A STAR CHART.  YOU CAN
 MOVE ABOUT, UNDER WARP DRIVE OR IMPULSE POWER.  YOU CAN ALSO
 DOCK AT A STARBASE, REST WHILE REPAIRS ARE BEING MADE, ABANDON
 SHIP, SELF DESTRUCT, OR GIVE UP AND START A NEW GAME.

     THE KLINGONS ARE WAITING.

                                                                        4

          ----------HOW TO ISSUE COMMANDS----------


     WHEN THE GAME IS WAITING FOR YOU TO ENTER A COMMAND, IT WILL
 PRINT OUT
          COMMAND:
 YOU MAY THEN TYPE IN YOUR COMMAND.  ALL YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER FOR
 EACH COMMAND IS THE MNEMONIC.  FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU WANT TO MOVE
 STRAIGHT UP FOR ONE QUADRANT, YOU CAN TYPE IN THE MNEMONIC
          MOVE
 AND THE COMPUTER WILL PROMPT YOU WITH
          MANUAL OR AUTOMATIC?
 SAY YOU TYPE IN "MANUAL".  THE COMPUTER THEN RESPONDS
          X AND Y DISPLACEMENTS:
 NOW YOU TYPE IN 0 1 WHICH SPECIFIES AN X MOVEMENT OF ZERO AND
 A Y MOVEMENT OF 1.

     WHEN YOU HAVE LEARNED THE COMMANDS, YOU CAN AVOID BEING
 PROMPTED BY SIMPLY TYPING IN THE INFORMATION WITHOUT WAITING
 TO BE ASKED FOR IT.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE ABOVE EXAMPLE, YOU
 COULD SIMPLY TYPE IN
          MOVE MANUAL 0 1
 AND IT WILL BE DONE.  OR YOU COULD TYPE IN
          MOVE MANUAL
 AND WHEN THE COMPUTER RESPONDS WITH
          X AND Y DISPLACEMENTS:
 YOU CAN TYPE IN
          0 1
 AND IT WILL UNDERSTAND.

     YOU CAN ABBREVIATE MOST MNEMONICS.  FOR "MOVE", YOU CAN USE
 ANY OF
          MOVE     MOV     MO     M
 SUCCESSFULLY.  FOR YOUR SAFETY, CERTAIN CRITICAL COMMANDS (SUCH
 AS TO ABANDON SHIP) MUST BE WRITTEN OUT IN FULL.  ALSO, IN A
 FEW CASES TWO OR MORE COMMANDS BEGIN WITH THE SAME LETTER, AND
 IN THIS CASE THAT LETTER REFERS TO A PARTICULAR ONE OF THE
 COMMANDS; TO GET THE OTHER, YOUR ABBREVIATION MUST BE TWO OR
 MORE LETTERS LONG.  THIS SOUNDS COMPLICATED, BUT YOU WILL LEARN
 THE ABBREVIATIONS QUICKLY ENOUGH.

     WHAT THIS ALL BOILS DOWN TO IS:
          (1)  YOU CAN ABBREVIATE PRACTICALLY ANYTHING,
          (2)  IF YOU FORGET, THE COMPUTER WILL PROMPT YOU,
          (3)  IF YOU REMEMBER, YOU CAN TYPE IT ALL ON ONE LINE.

     IF YOU ARE PART WAY THROUGH ENTERING A COMMAND AND YOU CHANGE
 YOUR MIND, YOU CAN CANCEL THE COMMAND BY TYPING A -1 AS ONE OF THE
 PARAMETERS.

     IF ANYTHING IS NOT CLEAR TO YOU, EXPERIMENT.  THE WORST YOU CAN
 DO IS LOSE A GAME OR TWO.

     MNEMONIC:  SRSCAN
     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  S
     FULL COMMANDS:  SRSCAN
                     SRSCAN NO

     THE SHORT-RANGE SCAN GIVES YOU A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF
 INFORMATION ABOUT THE QUADRANT YOUR STARSHIP IS IN.  A SHORT-
 RANGE SCAN IS BEST DESCRIBED BY AN EXAMPLE.

     THE LEFT PART IS A PICTURE OF THE QUADRANT.  THE E AT SECTOR
 2 - 4 REPRESENTS THE ENTERPRISE; THE B AT SECTOR 3 - 8 IS A STARBASE.
 THERE ARE ORDINARY KLINGONS (K) AT SECTORS 5 - 8 AND 6 - 2, AND A
 KLINGON COMMANDER (C) AT 9 - 9.  THE (GULP) "SUPER-COMMANDER" (S)
 OCCUPIES SECTOR 4 - 4, AND A ROMULAN (R) IS AT 1 - 6.  A PLANET (P)
 IS AT SECTOR 7 - 6.  THERE ARE ALSO A LARGE NUMBER OF STARS (*).
 THE PERIODS (.) ARE JUST EMPTY SPACE--THEY ARE PRINTED TO HELP
 YOU GET YOUR BEARINGS.  SECTOR 6 - 4 CONTAINS A BLACK HOLE (@).

     THE INFORMATION ON THE RIGHT IS ASSORTED STATUS INFORMATION.
 THE STATUS INFORMATION WILL BE ABSENT IF YOU TYPE <NO> AFTER
 SRSCAN.  OTHERWISE, STATUS INFORMATION WILL BE PRESENTED.

     SHORT-RANGE SCANS ARE FREE.  THAT IS, THEY USE UP NO ENERGY
 AND NO TIME.  IF YOU ARE IN BATTLE, DOING A SHORT-RANGE SCAN DOES
 NOT GIVE THE ENEMIES ANOTHER CHANCE TO HIT YOU.  YOU CAN SAFELY
 DO A SHORT-RANGE SCAN ANYTIME YOU LIKE.

     STARBASES ALSO HAVE SHORT RANGE SENSORS.  IF YOU ARE DOCKED
 AT A STARBASE AND YOUR SHORT RANGE SENSORS ARE DAMAGED, YOU
 MAY USE THE ONES AT THE STARBASE BY USING THE <SRSCAN> COMMAND.
        

                                                                        6

 *****************
 * STATUS REPORT *
 *****************

     MNEMONIC:  STATUS
     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  ST

     THIS COMMAND GIVES YOU INFORMATION ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF
 YOUR STARSHIP, AS FOLLOWS:

     STARDATE - THE CURRENT DATE.  A STARDATE IS THE SAME AS A DAY.

     CONDITION - THERE ARE FOUR POSSIBLE CONDITIONS:
          DOCKED - DOCKED AT STARBASE.
          RED    - IN BATTLE.
          YELLOW - LOW ON ENERGY ( < 1000 UNITS).
          GREEN  - NONE OF THE ABOVE.

     POSITION - QUADRANT IS GIVEN FIRST, THEN SECTOR.

     LIFE SUPPORT - IF "ACTIVE", LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS ARE
          FUNCTIONING NORMALLY.  IF ON "RESERVES", THE NUMBER
          IS HOW MANY STARDATES YOUR RESERVE FOOD, AIR, ETC. WILL
          LAST--YOU MUST GET REPAIRS MADE OR GET TO STARBASE
          BEFORE YOUR RESERVES RUN OUT.

     WARP FACTOR - WHAT YOUR WARP FACTOR IS CURRENTLY SET TO.

     ENERGY - THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY YOU HAVE LEFT.  IF IT DROPS TO
          ZERO, YOU DIE.

     TORPEDOES - HOW MANY PHOTON TORPEDOES YOU HAVE LEFT.

     SHIELDS - WHETHER YOUR SHIELDS ARE UP OR DOWN, HOW STRONG
          THEY ARE (WHAT PERCENT OF A HIT THEY CAN DEFLECT), AND
          SHIELD ENERGY.

     KLINGONS LEFT - HOW MANY OF THE KLINGONS ARE STILL OUT THERE.

     TIME LEFT - HOW LONG THE FEDERATION CAN HOLD OUT AGAINST THE
          PRESENT NUMBER OF KLINGONS; THAT IS, HOW LONG UNTIL THE
          END IF YOU DO NOTHING IN THE MEANTIME.  IF YOU KILL KLINGONS
          QUICKLY, THIS NUMBER WILL GO UP--IF NOT, IT WILL GO DOWN.
          IF IT REACHES ZERO, THE FEDERATION IS CONQUERED, AND YOU
          LOSE.

     STATUS INFORMATION IS FREE--IT USES NO TIME OR ENERGY, AND IF
 YOU ARE IN BATTLE, THE KLINGONS ARE NOT GIVEN ANOTHER CHANCE TO HIT
 YOU.

     STATUS INFORMATION CAN ALSO BE OBTAINED BY DOING A SHORT-RANGE
 SCAN.  SEE THE <SRSCAN> COMMAND FOR DETAILS.

     EACH ITEM OF INFORMATION CAN BE OBTAINED SINGLY BY REQUESTING
 IT.  SEE <REQUEST> COMMAND FOR DETAILS.

                                                                        7


 *******************
 * LONG-RANGE SCAN *
 *******************

     MNEMONIC:  LRSCAN
     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  L

     A LONG-RANGE SCAN GIVES YOU GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE YOU
 ARE AND WHAT IS AROUND YOU.  HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OUTPUT.

          L. R. SCAN FOR QUADRANT 5 - 1
             -1  107  103
             -1  316    5
             -1  105 1000

 THIS SCAN SAYS THAT YOU ARE IN ROW 5, COLUMN 1 OF THE 8 BY 8
 GALAXY.  THE NUMBERS IN THE SCAN INDICATE HOW MANY OF EACH
 KIND OF THING THERE IS IN YOUR QUADRANT AND ALL ADJACENT
 QUADRANTS.  THE DIGITS ARE INTERPRETED AS FOLLOWS.

     THOUSANDS DIGIT:  1000 INDICATES A SUPERNOVA (ONLY)
     HUNDREDS DIGIT:   NUMBER OF KLINGONS PRESENT
     TENS DIGIT:       NUMBER OF STARBASES PRESENT
     ONES DIGIT:       NUMBER OF STARS PRESENT

 FOR EXAMPLE, IN YOUR QUADRANT (5 - 1) THE NUMBER IS 316, WHICH
 INDICATES 3 KLINGONS, 1 STARBASE AND 6 STARS.  (THE LONG-RANGE
 SCANNER DOES NOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN ORDINARY KLINGONS AND
 KLINGON COMMAND SHIPS.)  IF THERE IS A SUPERNOVA, AS IN THE
 QUADRANT BELOW AND TO YOUR RIGHT (QUADRANT 6 - 2), THERE IS
 NOTHING ELSE IN THE QUADRANT.

     ROMULANS POSSESS A "CLOAKING DEVICE" WHICH PREVENTS THEIR
 DETECTION BY LONG-RANGE SCAN.  BECAUSE OF THIS FACT, STARFLEET
 COMMAND IS NEVER SURE HOW MANY ROMULANS ARE "OUT THERE".
 WHEN YOU KILL THE LAST KLINGON, THE REMAINING ROMULANS SURRENDER
 TO THE FEDERATION.

     PLANETS ARE ALSO UNDETECTABLE BY LONG-RANGE SCAN.  THE
 ONLY WAY TO DETECT A PLANET IS TO FIND IT IN YOUR CURRENT
 QUADRANT WITH SHORT-RANGE SENSORS.

     SINCE YOU ARE IN COLUMN 1, THERE ARE NO QUADRANTS TO YOUR
 LEFT.  THE MINUS ONES INDICATE THE NEGATIVE ENERGY BARRIER AT
 THE EDGE OF THE GALAXY, WHICH YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO CROSS.

     LONG-RANGE SCANS ARE FREE.  THEY USE UP NO ENERGY OR TIME,
 AND CAN BE DONE SAFELY REGARDLESS OF BATTLE CONDITIONS.

     STARBASES ALSO HAVE L.R. SENSORS.  IF YOU ARE DOCKED AND YOUR
 LONG-RANGE SENSORS ARE DAMAGED, YOU MAY USE THE ONES AT STARBASE
 BY USING THE <LRSCAN> COMMAND.

                                                                        8
 **************
 * STAR CHART *
 **************

     MNEMONIC:  CHART
     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  C

     AS YOU PROCEED IN THE GAME, YOU LEARN MORE AND MORE ABOUT
 WHAT THINGS ARE WHERE IN THE GALAXY.  THIS INFORMATION IS
 AUTOMATICALLY RECORDED FOR YOU (BY SPOCK) IN YOUR STAR CHART.

     THE CHART LOOKS LIKE AN 8 BY 8 ARRAY OF NUMBERS.  THESE
 NUMBERS ARE INTERPRETED EXACTLY AS THEY ARE ON A LONG-RANGE
 SCAN.  A PERIOD (.) IN PLACE OF A DIGIT MEANS YOU DO NOT KNOW
 THAT INFORMATION YET.  FOR EXAMPLE, ... MEANS YOU KNOW NOTHING
 ABOUT THE QUADRANT, WHILE .1. MEANS YOU KNOW THAT IT CONTAINS
 A BASE, BUT AN UNKNOWN NUMBER OF KLINGONS AND STARS.

     LOOKING AT THE STAR CHART IS A FREE OPERATION.  IT COSTS
 YOU NEITHER TIME NOR ENERGY, AND CAN BE DONE SAFELY WHETHER
 IN OR OUT OF BATTLE.


 *****************
 * DAMAGE REPORT *
 *****************

     MNEMONIC:  DAMAGES
     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  DA

     AT ANY TIME YOU MAY ASK FOR A DAMAGE REPORT TO FIND OUT WHAT
 DEVICES ARE DAMAGED AND HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO REPAIR THEM.
 NATURALLY, REPAIRS PROCEED FASTER AT A STARBASE.

     IF YOU SUFFER DAMAGES WHILE MOVING, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A
 SUBSEQUENT DAMAGE REPORT WILL NOT SHOW ANY DAMAGE.  THIS HAPPENS
 IF THE TIME SPENT ON THE MOVE EXCEEDS THE REPAIR TIME, SINCE IN
 THIS CASE THE DAMAGED DEVICES WERE FIXED EN ROUTE.

     DAMAGE REPORTS ARE FREE.  THEY USE NO ENERGY OR TIME, AND CAN
 BE DONE SAFELY EVEN IN THE MIDST OF BATTLE.


 *************************
 * MOVE UNDER WARP DRIVE *
 *************************

     MNEMONIC:  MOVE
     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  M
     FULL COMMAND:  MOVE <MANUAL> <DISPLACEMENT>
                    MOVE <AUTOMATIC> <DESTINATION>

     THIS COMMAND IS THE USUAL WAY TO MOVE FROM ONE PLACE TO
 ANOTHER WITHIN THE GALAXY.  YOU MOVE UNDER WARP DRIVE, ACCORDING
 TO THE CURRENT WARP FACTOR (SEE "WARP FACTOR").

                                                                        9
     THERE ARE TWO COMMAND MODES FOR MOVEMENT; MANUAL AND AUTOMATIC.
 THE MANUAL MODE IS DEFAULT, AND REQUIRES THE FOLLOWING FORMAT:

          MOVE <MANUAL> <DELTX> <DELTY>

 <MANUAL> IS OPTIONAL.  IF OMITTED, MANUAL MOVEMENT IS ASSUMED.
 <DELTX> AND <DELTY> ARE THE HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL DISPLACEMENTS FOR
 YOUR STARSHIP, IN QUADRANTS; A DISPLACEMENT OF ONE SECTOR IS 0.1
 QUADRANTS.  SPECIFYING <DELTX> AND <DELTY> CAUSES YOUR SHIP TO MOVE
 IN A STRAIGHT LINE TO THE SPECIFIED DESTINATION.  FOR EXAMPLE,
 THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE COMMAND TO MOVE 1 SECTOR TO THE RIGHT WOULD BE

          M .1 0

     THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLES OF MANUAL MOVEMENT REFER TO THE
 SHORT-RANGE SCAN ON PAGE 5.

     DESTINATION SECTOR      MANUAL MOVEMENT COMMAND

           3 - 1                    M -.3 -.1
           2 - 1                    M -.3 0
           1 - 2                    M -.2 .1
           1 - 4                    M 0 .1
     (LEAVING QUADRANT)             M 0 .2
           1 - 5                    M .1 .1
           2 - 10                   M .6 0
           5 - 6                    M .2 -.3
           3 - 4                    M 0 -.1

     THE AUTOMATIC MODE IS AS FOLLOWS:

          MOVE <AUTOMATIC> <QROW> <QCOL> <SROW> <SCOL>

 WHERE <QROW> AND <QCOL> ARE THE ROW AND COLUMN NUMBERS OF THE
 DESTINATION QUADRANT, AND <SROW> AND <SCOL> ARE THE ROW AND
 COLUMN NUMBERS OF THE DESTINATION SECTOR WITHIN THAT QUADRANT.
 THIS COMMAND ALSO MOVES YOUR SHIP IN A STRAIGHT LINE PATH TO
 THE DESTINATION.  <AUTOMATIC> (A IS SUFFICIENT) MUST BE PRESENT.
 FOR MOVING WITHIN A QUADRANT, <QROW> AND <QCOL> MAY BE OMITTED.
 FOR EXAMPLE, TO MOVE TO SECTOR 2 - 9 WITHIN THE CURRENT QUADRANT,
 THE SHORTEST COMMAND WOULD BE

          M A 2 9

 TO MOVE TO QUADRANT 3 - 7, SECTOR 5 - 8, TYPE

          M A 3 7 5 8

 AND IT WILL BE DONE.  IN AUTOMATIC MODE, EITHER TWO OR FOUR NUMBERS
 MUST BE SUPPLIED.

     AUTOMATIC MODE UTILIZES THE SHIP'S "BATTLE COMPUTER".  IF
 THE COMPUTER IS DAMAGED, MANUAL MOVEMENT MUST BE USED.

                                                                        10
     IT USES TIME AND ENERGY TO MOVE.  HOW MUCH TIME AND HOW MUCH
 ENERGY DEPENDS ON YOUR CURRENT WARP FACTOR, THE DISTANCE YOU MOVE,
 AND WHETHER YOUR SHIELDS ARE UP.  THE HIGHER THE WARP FACTOR, THE
 FASTER YOU MOVE, BUT HIGHER WARP FACTORS REQUIRE MORE ENERGY.
 YOU MAY MOVE WITH YOUR SHIELDS UP, BUT THIS DOUBLES THE ENERGY
 REQUIRED.

     EACH TIME YOU MOVE IN A QUADRANT CONTAINING KLINGONS, THEY
 HAVE A CHANCE TO ATTACK YOU.  IN THIS CASE, THE "ENERGY LEFT"
 MESSAGE YOU GET REFERS TO YOUR ENERGY AFTER THE ATTACK BUT BEFORE
 THE MOVE.  AS YOU MOVE, THE AMOUNT THAT THE KLINGONS HIT YOU WITH
 IS DEPENDENT ON YOUR AVERAGE DISTANCE FROM THEM.

 ***************
 * WARP FACTOR *
 ***************

     MNEMONIC:  WARP
     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  W
     FULL COMMAND:  WARP <NUMBER>

     YOUR WARP FACTOR CONTROLS THE SPEED OF YOUR STARSHIP.  THE
 LARGER THE WARP FACTOR, THE FASTER YOU GO AND THE MORE ENERGY
 YOU USE.

     YOUR MINIMUM WARP FACTOR IS 1.0 AND YOUR MAXIMUM WARP FACTOR
 IS 10.0 (WHICH IS 100 TIMES AS FAST AND USES 1000 TIMES AS MUCH
 ENERGY).  AT SPEEDS ABOVE WARP 6 THERE IS SOME DANGER OF CAUSING
 DAMAGE TO YOUR WARP ENGINES; THIS DAMAGE IS LARGER AT HIGHER
 WARP FACTORS AND ALSO DEPENDS ON HOW FAR YOU GO AT THAT WARP
 FACTOR.

     AT EXACTLY WARP 10 THERE IS SOME PROBABILITY OF ENTERING A
 SO-CALLED "TIME WARP" AND BEING THROWN FORWARD OR BACKWARD IN
 TIME.  THE FARTHER YOU GO AT WARP 10, THE GREATER IS THE PROBABILITY
 OF ENTERING THE TIME WARP.

 *******************
 * IMPULSE ENGINES *
 *******************

     MNEMONIC:  IMPULSE
     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  I
     FULL COMMAND:  IMPULSE <MANUAL OR AUTOMATIC> <DISPLACEMENT OR DESTINATION>

     THE IMPULSE ENGINES GIVE YOU A WAY TO MOVE WHEN YOUR WARP
 ENGINES ARE DAMAGED.  THEY MOVE YOU AT A SPEED OF 0.95 SECTORS
 PER STARDATE, WHICH IS THE EQUIVALENT OF A WARP FACTOR OF ABOUT
 0.975, SO THEY ARE MUCH TOO SLOW TO USE EXCEPT IN EMERGENCIES.

     MOVEMENT COMMANDS ARE INDICATED JUST AS IN THE "MOVE" COMMAND.

     THE IMPULSE ENGINES REQUIRE 20 UNITS OF ENERGY TO ENGAGE,
 PLUS 10 UNITS PER SECTOR (100 UNITS PER QUADRANT) TRAVELLED.
 IT DOES NOT COST EXTRA TO MOVE WITH THE SHIELDS UP.

                                                                        11
 *********************
 * DEFLECTOR SHIELDS *
 *********************

     MNEMONIC:  SHIELDS
     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  SH
     FULL COMMANDS:  SHIELDS UP
                     SHIELDS DOWN
                     SHIELDS TRANSFER <AMOUNT OF ENERGY TO TRANSFER>

     YOUR DEFLECTOR SHIELDS ARE A DEFENSIVE DEVICE TO PROTECT YOU
 FROM KLINGON ATTACKS (AND NEARBY NOVAS).  AS THE SHIELDS PROTECT
 YOU, THEY GRADUALLY WEAKEN.  A SHIELD STRENGTH OF 75 PERCENT, FOR
 EXAMPLE, MEANS THAT THE NEXT TIME A KLINGON HITS YOU, YOUR SHIELDS
 WILL DEFLECT 75 PERCENT OF THE HIT, AND LET 25 PERCENT GET THROUGH
 TO HURT YOU.

     IT COSTS 50 UNITS OF ENERGY TO RAISE SHIELDS, NOTHING TO LOWER
 THEM.  YOU MAY MOVE WITH YOUR SHIELDS UP; THIS COSTS NOTHING EXTRA
 UNDER IMPULSE POWER, BUT DOUBLES THE ENERGY REQUIRED FOR WARP DRIVE.

     EACH TIME YOU RAISE OR LOWER YOUR SHIELDS, THE KLINGONS HAVE
 ANOTHER CHANCE TO ATTACK.  SINCE SHIELDS DO NOT RAISE AND LOWER
 INSTANTANEOUSLY, THE HITS YOU RECEIVE WILL BE INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN
 WHAT THEY WOULD BE IF THE SHIELDS WERE COMPLETELY UP OR COMPLETELY DOWN.

     YOU MAY NOT FIRE PHASERS THROUGH YOUR SHIELDS.  HOWEVER,
 YOU MAY USE THE "HIGH-SPEED SHIELD CONTROL" TO LOWER SHIELDS,
 FIRE PHASERS, AND RAISE THE SHIELDS AGAIN BEFORE THE KLINGONS CAN
 REACT.  SINCE RAPID LOWERING AND RAISING OF THE SHIELDS REQUIRES
 MORE ENERGY THAN NORMAL SPEED OPERATION, IT COSTS YOU 200 UNITS OF
 ENERGY TO ACTIVATE THIS CONTROL.  IT IS AUTOMATICALLY ACTIVATED WHEN
 YOU FIRE PHASERS WHILE SHIELDS ARE UP.  YOU MAY FIRE PHOTON TORPEDOES,
 BUT THEY MAY BE DEFLECTED CONSIDERABLY FROM THEIR INTENDED COURSE
 AS THEY PASS THROUGH THE SHIELDS (DEPENDING ON SHIELD STRENGTH).

     YOU MAY TRANSFER ENERGY BETWEEN THE SHIP'S ENERGY (GIVEN AS
 <ENERGY> IN STATUS) AND THE SHIELDS.  <TRANSFER> MAY BE ABBREVIATED
 <T>.  <AMOUNT OF ENERGY TO TRANSFER> IS THE NUMBER OF UNITS OF
 ENERGY YOU WISH TO TAKE FROM THE SHIP'S ENERGY AND PUT INTO THE
 SHIELDS.  IF YOU SPECIFY A NEGATIVE NUMBER, ENERGY IS DRAINED
 FROM THE SHIELDS TO THE SHIP.  TRANSFERRING ENERGY CONSTITUTES A
 TURN.  IF YOU TRANSFER ENERGY TO THE SHIELDS WHILE UNDER ATTACK,
 THEY WILL BE AT THE NEW ENERGY LEVEL WHEN YOU ARE NEXT HIT.

                                                                        12
 ***********
 * PHASERS *
 ***********

     MNEMONIC:  PHASERS
     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:   P
     FULL COMMANDS:   PHASERS AUTOMATIC <AMOUNT TO FIRE> <NO>
                      PHASERS <AMOUNT TO FIRE> <NO>
                      PHASERS MANUAL <NO> <AMOUNT 1> <AMOUNT 2> ... <AMOUNT N>

     PHASERS ARE ENERGY WEAPONS.  AS YOU FIRE PHASERS AT KLINGONS,
 YOU SPECIFY AN <AMOUNT TO FIRE> WHICH IS DRAWN FROM YOUR ENERGY
 RESERVES.  THE AMOUNT OF TOTAL HIT REQUIRED TO KILL AN ENEMY IS
 PARTLY RANDOM, BUT ALSO DEPENDS ON SKILL LEVEL.

     THE AVERAGE HIT REQUIRED TO KILL AN ORDINARY KLINGON VARIES
 FROM 200 UNITS IN THE NOVICE GAME TO 250 UNITS IN THE EMERITUS
 GAME.  COMMANDERS NORMALLY REQUIRE FROM 600 (NOVICE) TO 700
 (EMERITUS).  THE "SUPER-COMMANDER" REQUIRES FROM 875 (GOOD)
 TO 1000 (EMERITUS).  ROMULANS REQUIRE AN AVERAGE OF 350 (NOVICE)
 TO 450 (EMERITUS).

     HITS ON ENEMIES ARE CUMULATIVE, AS LONG AS YOU DO NOT LEAVE
 THE QUADRANT.

     IN GENERAL, NOT ALL THAT YOU FIRE WILL REACH THE KLINGONS.
 THE FARTHER AWAY THEY ARE, THE LESS PHASER ENERGY WILL REACH THEM.
 IF A KLINGON IS ADJACENT TO YOU, HE WILL RECEIVE ABOUT 90 PERCENT
 OF THE PHASER ENERGY DIRECTED AT HIM; A KLINGON 5 SECTORS AWAY
 WILL RECEIVE ABOUT 60 PERCENT, AND A KLINGON 10 SECTORS AWAY WILL
 RECEIVE ABOUT 35 PERCENT.  THERE IS SOME RANDOMNESS INVOLVED, SO
 THESE FIGURES ARE NOT EXACT.  PHASERS HAVE NO EFFECT BEYOND THE
 BOUNDARIES OF THE QUADRANT YOU ARE IN.

     PHASERS MAY OVERHEAT (AND BE DAMAGED) IF YOU FIRE TOO LARGE
 A BURST AT ONCE.  FIRING UP TO 1500 UNITS IS SAFE.  FROM 1500
 ON UP, THE PROBABILITY OF OVERHEAT INCREASES WITH THE AMOUNT FIRED.

     IF PHASER FIRING IS AUTOMATIC, THE COMPUTER DECIDES HOW TO
 DIVIDE UP YOUR <AMOUNT TO FIRE> AMONG THE KLINGONS PRESENT.  IF
 PHASER FIRING IS MANUAL, YOU SPECIFY HOW MUCH ENERGY TO FIRE AT
 EACH KLINGON PRESENT (NEAREST FIRST), RATHER THAN JUST SPECIFYING
 A TOTAL AMOUNT.  YOU CAN ABBREVIATE "MANUAL" AND "AUTOMATIC" TO
 ONE OR MORE LETTERS; IF YOU MENTION NEITHER, AUTOMATIC FIRING IS
 USUALLY ASSUMED.

     A SAFETY INTERLOCK PREVENTS PHASERS FROM BEING FIRED THROUGH
 THE SHIELDS.  IF THIS WERE NOT SO, THE SHIELDS WOULD CONTAIN
 YOUR FIRE AND YOU WOULD FRY YOURSELF.  HOWEVER, YOU MAY UTILIZE
 THE "HIGH-SPEED SHIELD CONTROL" TO DROP SHIELDS, FIRE PHASERS,
 AND RAISE SHIELDS BEFORE THE ENEMY CAN REACT.  SINCE IT TAKES
 MORE ENERGY TO RAISE THE SHIELDS RAPIDLY AFTER A SHOT, IT COSTS
 YOU 200 UNITS OF ENERGY EACH TIME YOU ACTIVATE THIS CONTROL.  IT
 IS AUTOMATICALLY ACTIVATED WHEN YOU FIRE PHASERS WHILE SHIELDS ARE UP.
 BY SPECIFYING THE <NO> OPTION, SHIELDS ARE NOT RAISED AFTER FIRING.

     PHASERS HAVE NO EFFECT ON STARBASES (WHICH ARE SHIELDED) OR
 ON STARS.

                                                                        13
 ********************
 * PHOTON TORPEDOES *
 ********************

     MNEMONIC:  PHOTONS
     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  PHO
     FULL COMMANDS:  PHOTONS <NUMBER> <TARG1> <TARG2> <TARG3>

     PHOTON TORPEDOES ARE PROJECTILE WEAPONS--YOU EITHER HIT WHAT
 YOU AIM AT, OR YOU DON'T.  THERE ARE NO "PARTIAL HITS".

     ONE PHOTON TORPEDO WILL USUALLY KILL ONE ORDINARY KLINGON,
 BUT IT USUALLY TAKES ABOUT TWO FOR A KLINGON COMMANDER.  PHOTON
 TORPEDOES CAN ALSO BLOW UP STARS AND STARBASES, IF YOU AREN'T
 CAREFUL.

     YOU MAY FIRE PHOTON TORPEDOES SINGLY, OR IN BURSTS OF TWO
 OR THREE.  EACH TORPEDO IS INDIVIDUALLY TARGETABLE.  THE COMPUTER
 WILL PROMPT YOU, ASKING FOR THE TARGET SECTOR FOR EACH TORPEDO.
 ALTERNATELY, YOU MAY SPECIFY EACH TARGET IN THE COMMAND LINE.

     PHOTON TORPEDOES CANNOT BE AIMED PRECISELY--THERE IS ALWAYS
 SOME RANDOMNESS INVOLVED IN THE DIRECTION THEY GO.  PHOTON
 TORPEDOES MAY BE FIRED WITH YOUR SHIELDS UP, BUT AS THEY PASS
 THROUGH THE SHIELDS THEY ARE RANDOMLY DEFLECTED FROM THEIR
 INTENDED COURSE EVEN MORE.

     PHOTON TORPEDOES ARE PROXIMITY-FUSED.  THE CLOSER THEY
 EXPLODE TO THE ENEMY, THE MORE DAMAGE THEY DO.  THERE IS A HIT
 "WINDOW" ABOUT 1 SECTOR WIDE.  IF THE TORPEDO MISSES THE HIT
 WINDOW, IT DOES NOT EXPLODE AND THE ENEMY IS UNAFFECTED.
 PHOTON TORPEDOES ARE ONLY EFFECTIVE WITHIN THE QUADRANT.  THEY
 HAVE NO EFFECT ON THINGS IN ADJACENT QUADRANTS.

     IF MORE THAN ONE TORPEDO IS FIRED AND ONLY ONE TARGET
 SECTOR IS SPECIFIED, ALL TORPEDOES ARE FIRED AT THAT SECTOR.
 FOR EXAMPLE, TO FIRE TWO TORPEDOES AT SECTOR 3 - 4, YOU TYPE

     PHO 2 3 4           (OR)           PHO 2 3 4 3 4

 TO FIRE TORPEDOES AT, CONSECUTIVELY, SECTORS 2 - 6, 1 - 10,
 AND 4 - 7, TYPE

     PHO 3 2 6 1 10 4 7

 THERE IS NO RESTRICTION TO FIRE DIRECTLY AT A SECTOR.  FOR
 EXAMPLE, YOU CAN ENTER

       PHO 1 3 2.5

 TO AIM BETWEEN TWO SECTORS.  HOWEVER, SECTOR NUMBERS MUST BE
 1 TO 10 INCLUSIVE.

                                                                        14
 ********************
 * DOCK AT STARBASE *
 ********************

     MNEMONIC:  DOCK
     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  D

     YOU MAY DOCK YOUR STARSHIP WHENEVER YOU ARE IN ONE OF THE
 EIGHT SECTOR POSITIONS IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO A STARBASE.  WHEN
 YOU DOCK, YOUR STARSHIP IS RESUPPLIED WITH ENERGY, SHIELD ENERGY
 PHOTON TORPEDOES, AND LIFE SUPPORT RESERVES.  REPAIRS ALSO PROCEED
 FASTER AT STARBASE, SO IF SOME OF YOUR DEVICES ARE DAMAGED,
 YOU MAY WISH TO STAY AT BASE (BY USING THE "REST" COMMAND)
 UNTIL THEY ARE FIXED.  IF YOUR SHIP HAS MORE THAN ITS NORMAL
 MAXIMUM ENERGY (WHICH CAN HAPPEN IF YOU'VE LOADED CRYSTALS)
 THE SHIP'S ENERGY IS NOT CHANGED.

     YOU MAY NOT DOCK WHILE IN STANDARD ORBIT AROUND A PLANET.

     STARBASES HAVE THEIR OWN DEFLECTOR SHIELDS, SO YOU ARE
 COMPLETELY SAFE FROM ATTACK WHILE DOCKED.  YOU ARE ALSO SAFE
 FROM LONG-RANGE TRACTOR BEAMS.

 ********
 * REST *
 ********

     MNEMONIC:  REST
     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  R
     FULL COMMAND:  REST <NUMBER OF STARDATES>

     THIS COMMAND SIMPLY ALLOWS THE SPECIFIED NUMBER OF STARDATES
 TO GO BY.  THIS IS USEFUL IF YOU HAVE SUFFERED DAMAGES AND WISH
 TO WAIT UNTIL REPAIRS ARE MADE BEFORE YOU GO BACK INTO BATTLE.

     IT IS NOT GENERALLY ADVISABLE TO REST WHILE YOU ARE UNDER
 ATTACK BY KLINGONS.

 **************************
 * CALL STARBASE FOR HELP *
 **************************

     MNEMONIC:  HELP
     (NO ABBREVIATION)

     WHEN YOU GET INTO SERIOUS TROUBLE, YOU MAY CALL STARBASE FOR
 HELP.  STARBASES HAVE A DEVICE CALLED A "LONG-RANGE TRANSPORTER
 BEAM" WHICH THEY CAN USE TO TELEPORT YOU TO BASE.  THIS WORKS BY
 DEMATERIALIZING YOUR STARSHIP AT ITS CURRENT POSITION AND (HOPEFULLY)
 RE-MATERIALIZING IT ADJACENT TO THE NEAREST STARBASE.  TELEPORTATION
 IS INSTANTANEOUS, AND STARBASE SUPPLIES THE REQUIRED ENERGY--ALL YOU
 HAVE TO DO IS LET THEM KNOW (VIA SUBSPACE RADIO) THAT YOU NEED HELP.

                                                                        15
     THIS COMMAND SHOULD BE EMPLOYED ONLY WHEN ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.
 IN THE FIRST PLACE, CALLING FOR HELP IS AN ADMISSION ON YOUR PART
 THAT YOU GOT YOURSELF INTO SOMETHING YOU CANNOT GET YOURSELF OUT
 OF, AND YOU ARE HEAVILY PENALIZED FOR THIS IN THE FINAL SCORING.
 SECONDLY, THE LONG-RANGE TRANSPORTER BEAM IS NOT RELIABLE--STARBASE
 CAN ALWAYS MANAGE TO DEMATERIALIZE YOUR STARSHIP, BUT (DEPENDING
 ON DISTANCE) MAY OR MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RE-MATERIALIZE YOU AGAIN.
 THE LONG-RANGE TRANSPORTER BEAM HAS NO ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM RANGE;
 IF YOU ARE IN THE SAME QUADRANT AS A STARBASE, YOU HAVE A GOOD
 CHANCE (ABOUT 90 PERCENT) OF RE-MATERIALIZING SUCCESSFULLY.
 YOUR CHANCES DROP TO ROUGHLY 50-50 AT JUST OVER 3 QUADRANTS.



 ****************
 * ABANDON SHIP *
 ****************

     MNEMONIC:  ABANDON
     (NO ABBREVIATION)

     YOU MAY ABANDON THE ENTERPRISE IF NECESSARY.  IF THERE IS
 STILL A STARBASE IN THE GALAXY, YOU WILL BE SENT THERE AND PUT
 IN CHARGE OF A WEAKER SHIP, THE FAERIE QUEENE.

     THE FAERIE QUEENE CANNOT BE ABANDONED.

 *****************
 * SELF-DESTRUCT *
 *****************

     MNEMONIC:  DESTRUCT
     (NO ABBREVIATION)

     YOU MAY SELF-DESTRUCT, THUS KILLING YOURSELF AND ENDING THE
 GAME.  IF THERE ARE NEARBY KLINGONS, YOU MAY TAKE A FEW OF THEM
 WITH YOU (THE MORE ENERGY YOU HAVE LEFT, THE BIGGER THE BANG).

     IN ORDER TO SELF-DESTRUCT YOU MUST REMEMBER THE PASSWORD YOU
 TYPED IN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME.



 ******************************
 * TERMINATE THE CURRENT GAME *
 ******************************

     MNEMONIC:  TERMINATE
     (NO ABBREVIATION)

     IMMEDIATELY CANCEL THE CURRENT GAME; NO CONCLUSION IS REACHED.
 YOU WILL BE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO START A NEW GAME OR TO LEAVE
 THE STAR TREK PROGRAM.

                                                                        16
 ***************
 * SENSOR-SCAN *
 ***************

     MNEMONIC:  SENSORS
     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  SE

     UTILIZING THE SHORT-RANGE SENSORS, SCIENCE OFFICER
 SPOCK GIVES YOU A READOUT ON ANY PLANET IN YOUR QUADRANT.
 PLANETS COME IN THREE CLASSES: M, N, AND O.  ONLY CLASS M
 PLANETS HAVE EARTH-LIKE CONDITIONS.  SPOCK INFORMS YOU IF THE
 PLANET HAS ANY DILITHIUM CRYSTALS.  SENSOR SCANS ARE FREE.

 ************************
 * ENTER STANDARD ORBIT *
 ************************

     MNEMONIC:  ORBIT
     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  O

     TO LAND ON A PLANET YOU MUST FIRST BE IN STANDARD ORBIT.
 YOU ACHIEVE THIS IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO DOCKING AT STARBASE.
 MOVING TO ONE OF THE EIGHT SECTOR POSITIONS IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT
 TO THE PLANET, YOU GIVE THE ORBIT COMMAND WHICH PUTS YOUR SHIP
 INTO STANDARD ORBIT ABOUT THE PLANET.  SINCE THIS IS A MANEUVER,
 A SMALL AMOUNT OF TIME IS USED; NEGLIGIBLE ENERGY IS REQUIRED.
 IF ENEMIES ARE PRESENT, THEY WILL ATTACK.

 **********************
 * TRANSPORTER-TRAVEL *
 **********************

     MNEMONIC:  TRANSPORT
     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  T

     THE TRANSPORTER IS A DEVICE WHICH CAN CONVERT ANY PHYSICAL
 OBJECT INTO ENERGY, BEAM THE ENERGY THROUGH SPACE, AND RECONSTRUCT
 THE PHYSICAL OBJECT AT SOME DESTINATION.  TRANSPORTING IS ONE
 WAY TO LAND ON A PLANET.  SINCE THE TRANSPORTER HAS A LIMITED
 RANGE, YOU MUST BE IN STANDARD ORBIT TO BEAM DOWN TO A PLANET.
 SHIELDS MUST BE DOWN WHILE TRANSPORTING.

     THE TRANSPORT COMMAND IS USED TO BEAM A LANDING PARTY ONTO
 A PLANET TO MINE "DILITHIUM CRYSTALS".  EACH TIME THE COMMAND
 IS GIVEN THE LANDING PARTY (WHICH YOU LEAD) MOVES FROM THE SHIP
 TO THE PLANET, OR VICE-VERSA.

     YOU ARE ADVISED AGAINST NEEDLESS TRANSPORTING, SINCE LIKE
 ALL DEVICES, THE TRANSPORTER WILL SOMETIMES MALFUNCTION.

     THE TRANSPORTER CONSUMES NEGLIGIBLE TIME AND ENERGY.  ITS
 USE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A "TURN".

                                                                        17
 *****************
 * SHUTTLE CRAFT *
 *****************

     MNEMONIC:  SHUTTLE
     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  SHU

     AN ALTERNATE WAY TO TRAVEL TO AND FROM PLANETS.  BECAUSE
 OF LIMITED RANGE, YOU MUST BE IN STANDARD ORBIT TO USE THE
 SHUTTLE CRAFT, NAMED "GALILEO".  SHIELDS MUST BE DOWN.

     UNLIKE TRANSPORTING, USE OF THE SHUTTLE CRAFT DOES CONSTITUTE
 A "TURN" SINCE TIME IS CONSUMED.  THE TIME NATURALLY DEPENDS
 ON ORBIT ALTITUDE, BUT WILL USUALLY BE LESS THAN 0.2 STARDATES.
 SHUTTLING USES NO SHIP ENERGY.

 ***************************
 * MINE DILITHIUM CRYSTALS *
 ***************************

     MNEMONIC:  MINE
     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  MI

     ONCE YOU AND YOUR MINING PARTY ARE ON THE SURFACE OF A
 PLANET WHICH HAS DILITHIUM CRYSTALS, THIS COMMAND WILL DIG THEM
 FOR YOU.

     MINING REQUIRES TIME AND CONSTITUTES A "TURN".  NO ENERGY
 IS USED.  CLASS M PLANETS REQUIRE 0.1 TO 0.3 STARDATES TO MINE.
 CLASS N PLANETS TAKE TWICE AS LONG, AND CLASS O PLANETS TAKE
 THREE TIMES AS LONG.

     DILITHIUM CRYSTALS CONTAIN ENORMOUS ENERGY IN A FORM
 THAT IS READILY RELEASED IN THE SHIP'S POWER SYSTEM.  IT
 IS AN EXCELLENT IDEA TO MINE THEM WHENEVER POSSIBLE, FOR USE
 IN EMERGENCIES.  ONCE YOU HAVE MINED CRYSTALS, AND HAVE THEM
 SAFELY ABOARD SHIP, YOU HAVE A SUPPLY THAT WILL LAST THE ENTIRE
 GAME.  THERE IS NO NEED TO GO BACK FOR MORE (UNLESS YOU ABANDON
 SHIP).

 ***************************
 * LOAD DILITHIUM CRYSTALS *
 ***************************

     MNEMONIC:  CRYSTALS
     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  CR

     THIS IS A VERY POWERFUL COMMAND WHICH SHOULD BE USED WITH
 CAUTION.  ONCE YOU HAVE DILITHIUM CRYSTALS ABOARD SHIP, THIS
 COMMAND WILL INSTRUCT ENGINEERING OFFICER SCOTT AND MR. SPOCK
 TO PLACE A RAW DILITHIUM CRYSTAL INTO THE POWER CHANNEL OF THE
 SHIP'S MATTER-ANTIMATTER CONVERTER.  WHEN IT WORKS, THIS COMMAND
 WILL GREATLY BOOST THE SHIP'S ENERGY.

                                                                        18
     BECAUSE THE CRYSTALS ARE RAW AND IMPURE, INSTABILITIES
 CAN OCCUR IN THE POWER CHANNEL.  USUALLY SCOTTY CAN CONTROL
 THESE.  WHEN HE CANNOT, THE RESULTS ARE DISASTROUS.

     EVEN IF THE CRYSTALS ARE LOADED SUCCESSFULLY, SOME DAMAGE
 IS INEVITABLY DONE TO THE POWER CHANNEL.  THIS DAMAGE HAS NO
 EFFECT ON THE OPERATION OF THE POWER PLANT, BUT WILL MAKE IT MORE
 DIFFICULT TO CONTROL INSTABILITIES THE NEXT TIME CRYSTALS ARE
 LOADED.

     SINCE USING RAW DILITHIUM CRYSTALS FOR THIS PURPOSE ENTAILS
 CONSIDERABLE RISK, STARFLEET REGULATIONS ALLOW ITS USE ONLY DURING
 "CONDITION YELLOW".  NO TIME OR ENERGY IS USED.

 ON PLANETS IN THE GALAXY.  SINCE PLANETS DO NOT SHOW UP ON
 LONG-RANGE SCANS, THE ONLY WAY TO OBTAIN THIS INFORMATION IS
 WITH THE "SENSORS" COMMAND.

 **********
 * FREEZE *
 **********

     MNEMONIC:  FREEZE
     (NO ABBREVIATION)
     FULL COMMAND:  FREEZE <FILE NAME>

     THE PURPOSE OF THE <FREEZE> COMMAND IS TO ALLOW A PLAYER
 TO SAVE THE CURRENT STATE OF THE GAME, SO THAT IT CAN BE FINISHED
 LATER.  A FILE WITH THE SPECIFIED <FILE NAME> AND TYPE '.TRK' IS
 CREATED (IF NECESSARY) IN THE CURRENT DIRECTORY, AND ALL PERTINENT
 INFORMATION ABOUT THE GAME IS WRITTEN TO THAT FILE.  THE GAME
 IS THEN TERMINATED, AND YOU ARE GIVEN THE CHOICE OF STARTING A NEW
 GAME OR LEAVING THE PROGRAM.  YOU MAY CONTINUE THE CURRENT GAME
 USING THE PROCEDURE DESCRIBED NEXT.

     TO RESTART A GAME CREATED BY THE "FREEZE" COMMAND, THE USER
 NEED ONLY TYPE "FROZEN" IN RESPONSE TO THE INITIAL QUESTION
 ABOUT THE TYPE OF GAME DESIRED, FOLLOWED BY THE <FILE NAME>.

     NOTE:  A "TOURNAMENT" GAME IS LIKE A FROZEN GAME, WITH THE
 FOLLOWING DIFFERENCES.  (1)  TOURNAMENT GAMES ALWAYS START FROM
 THE BEGINNING, WHILE A FROZEN GAME CAN START AT ANY POINT.
 (2)  TOURNAMENT GAMES REQUIRE ONLY THAT THE PLAYER REMEMBER THE
 NAME OR NUMBER OF THE TOURNAMENT, WHILE THE INFORMATION ABOUT A
 FROZEN GAME MUST BE KEPT ON A FILE.

     A POINT WORTH NOTING IS THAT 'FREEZE' DOES NOT SAVE THE SEED
 FOR THE RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR, SO THAT IDENTICAL ACTIONS AFTER
 RESTARTING THE SAME FROZEN GAME CAN LEAD TO DIFFERENT RESULTS.
 HOWEVER, IDENTICAL ACTIONS AFTER STARTING A GIVEN TOURNAMENT
 GAME ALWAYS LEAD TO THE SAME RESULTS.

 **************************
 * EXPERIMENTAL DEATH RAY *
 **************************

     MNEMONIC:  DEATHRAY
     (NO ABBREVIATION)

     THIS COMMAND SHOULD BE USED ONLY IN THOSE DESPERATE CASES
 WHERE YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO ALTERNATIVE.  THE DEATH RAY USES
 ENERGY TO REARRANGE MATTER.  UNFORTUNATELY, ITS WORKING PRINCIPLES
 ARE NOT YET THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD, AND THE RESULTS ARE HIGHLY
 UNPREDICTABLE.

      THE DEATH RAY IS A VERY DELICATE DEVICE AND IS USUALLY DAMAGED
 AFTER ITS FIRST USE.  THE FIRST TIME ONE USES THE DEATH RAY, THERE
 IS A SEVENTY PERCENT CHANCE OF ITS FUNCTIONING CORRECTLY.  WHEN IT
 WORKS, THE DEATH RAY ELIMINATES ALL THE ENEMIES IN THE QUADRANT.
 WHEN IT DOES NOT.....................

      IF THE DEATH RAY IS DAMAGED IN ITS USE, IT MUST BE TOTALLY
 REPLACED.  THIS CAN ONLY BE DONE AT STARBASE.  BECAUSE IT IS A VERY
 COMPLEX DEVICE, IT TAKES 9.99 STARDATES AT BASE TO REPLACE THE
 DEATH RAY.

      THE DEATH RAY CANNOT BE REPAIRED IN FLIGHT.

                                                                        20
 ******************
 * EMERGENCY EXIT *
 ******************

     MNEMONIC:  EMEXIT
     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  E

     THIS COMMAND PROVIDES A QUICK WAY TO EXIT FROM THE GAME WHEN
 YOU OBSERVE A KLINGON BATTLE CRUISER APPROACHING YOUR TERMINAL.
 ITS EFFECT IS TO FREEZE THE GAME ON THE FILE 'EMSAVE.TRK' IN YOUR
 CURRENT DIRECTORY, ERASE THE SCREEN (IF YOU ARE PLAYING AT A VT52),
 AND EXIT.

     A SHORT IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:  THE SCREEN ERASURE IS DONE BY THE
 MODULE 'GETOUT', WHICH CAN EASILY BE MODIFIED TO HANDLE TERMINALS
 THAT USE DIFFERENT CONTROL OR ESCAPE SEQUENCES TO EFFECT SCREEN
 ERASURE.

 ***************
 * GAME REPORT *
 ***************

     MNEMONIC:  GAME
     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  G

     THIS COMMAND SUPPLIES YOU WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE STATE OF THE
 CURRENT GAME.  ITS PURPOSE IS TO REMIND YOU OF THINGS THAT YOU HAVE
 LEARNED DURING PLAY, BUT MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN, AND CANNOT OTHERWISE
 RETRIEVE IF YOU ARE NOT PLAYING AT A HARD-COPY TERMINAL.

     YOU ARE TOLD THE FOLLOWING THINGS:

       . THE LENGTH AND SKILL LEVEL OF THE GAME YOU ARE PLAYING
       . THE ORIGINAL NUMBER OF KLINGONS
       . HOW MANY KLINGONS YOU HAVE DESTROYED
       . WHETHER THE SUPER-COMMANDER HAS BEEN DESTROYED
       . HOW MANY BASES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED
       . HOW MANY BASES ARE LEFT
       . WHAT BASES (IF ANY) ARE UNDER ATTACK; YOU MUST HAVE BEEN
         INFORMED OF THE ATTACK VIA SUBSPACE RADIO
       . HOW MANY CASUALTIES YOU HAVE SUFFERED
       . HOW MANY TIMES YOU HAVE CALLED FOR HELP.

 YOU ARE ALSO WARNED IF THE SUBSPACE RADIO HAS BEEN DAMAGED, WHICH
 MAY RENDER YOUR INFORMATION INCOMPLETE.

     THIS SAME INFORMATION IS AUTOMATICALLY GIVEN TO YOU WHEN YOU
 START TO PLAY A FROZEN GAME.

                                                                        21
               ----------MISCELLANEOUS NOTES----------

     STARBASES CAN BE ATTACKED BY EITHER COMMANDERS OR BY THE
 "SUPER-COMMANDER".  WHEN THIS HAPPENS, YOU WILL BE NOTIFIED
 BY SUBSPACE RADIO, PROVIDED IT IS WORKING.  THE MESSAGE WILL
 INFORM YOU HOW LONG THE BASE UNDER ATTACK CAN LAST.  SINCE THE
 "SUPER-COMMANDER" IS MORE POWERFUL THAN AN ORDINARY COMMANDER,
 HE CAN DESTROY A BASE MORE QUICKLY.

     THE "SUPER-COMMANDER" TRAVELS AROUND THE GALAXY AT A SPEED
 OF ABOUT WARP 6 OR 7.  HIS MOVEMENT IS STRICTLY TIME BASED; THE
 MORE TIME PASSES, THE FURTHER HE CAN GO.

     SCATTERED THROUGH THE GALAXY ARE CERTAIN ZONES OF CONTROL,
 COLLECTIVELY DESIGNATED THE "ROMULAN NEUTRAL ZONE".  ANY
 QUADRANT WHICH CONTAINS ROMULANS WITHOUT KLINGONS IS PART OF THE
 NEUTRAL ZONE, EXCEPT IF A BASE IS PRESENT.  SINCE ROMULANS DO NOT
 SHOW ON EITHER THE LONG-RANGE SCAN OR THE STAR CHART, IT IS EASY
 FOR YOU TO STUMBLE INTO THIS ZONE.  WHEN YOU DO, IF YOUR SUBSPACE
 RADIO IS WORKING, YOU WILL RECEIVE A WARNING MESSAGE FROM THE
 ROMULAN, POLITELY ASKING YOU TO LEAVE.

     IN GENERAL, ROMULANS ARE A GALACTIC NUISANCE.

     THE HIGH-SPEED SHIELD CONTROL IS FAIRLY RELIABLE, BUT IT HAS
 BEEN KNOWN TO MALFUNCTION.

     YOU CAN OBSERVE THE GALACTIC MOVEMENTS OF THE "SUPER-COMMANDER"
 ON THE STAR CHART, PROVIDED HE IS IN TERRITORY YOU HAVE SCANNED.

     PERIODICALLY, YOU WILL RECEIVE INTELLIGENCE REPORTS FROM
 STARFLEET COMMAND, INDICATING THE CURRENT QUADRANT OF THE
 "SUPER-COMMANDER".  YOUR SUBSPACE RADIO MUST BE WORKING, OF
 COURSE.

     EACH QUADRANT WILL CONTAIN FROM 0 TO 3 BLACK HOLES.
 TORPEDOES ENTERING A BLACK HOLE DISAPPEAR.  IN FACT, ANYTHING
 ENTERING A BLACK HOLE DISAPPEARS, PERMANENTLY.  IF YOU CAN DISPLACE
 AN ENEMY INTO ONE, HE IS A GONER.  BLACK HOLES DO NOT NECESSARILY
 REMAIN IN A QUADRANT.  THEY ARE TRANSIENT PHENOMENA.

     BATTLE COMPUTER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE BY FIRING PHASERS
 MANUALLY, AND ALLOWING THE COMPUTER TO PROMPT YOU.  IF YOU ENTER
 ZERO FOR THE AMOUNT TO FIRE AT EACH ENEMY, YOU WILL GET A
 COMPLETE REPORT, WITHOUT COST.  THE BATTLE COMPUTER WILL TELL YOU HOW
 MUCH PHASER ENERGY TO FIRE AT EACH ENEMY FOR A SURE KILL.  THIS
 INFO APPEARS IN PARENTHESES PRIOR TO THE PROMPT FOR EACH ENEMY.
 SINCE THE AMOUNT IS COMPUTED FROM SENSOR DATA, IF EITHER THE COMPUTER
 OR S.R. SENSORS ARE DAMAGED, THIS INFO WILL BE UNAVAILABLE, AND
 PHASERS MUST BE FIRED MANUALLY.  BATTLE COMPUTER INFORMATION CAN BE
 OBTAINED EVEN IF THE PHASERS ARE DAMAGED (OR OTHERWISE UNUSABLE),
 PROVIDED THE COMPUTER AND SHORT-RANGE SENSORS ARE BOTH WORKING.

     IF WARP ENGINES ARE DAMAGED LESS THAN 10 STARDATES (UNDOCKED)
 YOU CAN STILL GO WARP 4.

                                                                        22

                     ----------SCORING----------


     SCORING IS FAIRLY SIMPLE.  YOU GET POINTS FOR GOOD THINGS, AND
 YOU LOSE POINTS FOR BAD THINGS.

 YOU GAIN--

     (1)   10 POINTS FOR EACH ORDINARY KLINGON YOU KILL,
     (2)   50 POINTS FOR EACH COMMANDER YOU KILL,
     (3)  200 POINTS FOR KILLING THE "SUPER-COMMANDER",
     (4)   20 POINTS FOR EACH ROMULAN KILLED,
     (5)    1 POINT FOR EACH ROMULAN CAPTURED.
     (6)  500 TIMES YOUR AVERAGE KLINGON/STARDATE KILL RATE.  IF YOU
               LOSE THE GAME, YOUR KILL RATE IS BASED ON A MINIMUM OF
               5 STARDATES.
     (7)  YOU GET A BONUS IF YOU WIN THE GAME, BASED ON YOUR RATING:
               NOVICE=100, FAIR=200, GOOD=300, EXPERT=400, EMERITUS=500.

 YOU LOSE--

     (8)  200 POINTS IF YOU GET YOURSELF KILLED,
     (9)  100 POINTS FOR EACH STARBASE YOU DESTROY,
    (10)  100 POINTS FOR EACH STARSHIP YOU LOSE,
    (11)   45 POINTS FOR EACH TIME YOU HAD TO CALL FOR HELP,
    (12)   10 POINTS FOR EACH PLANET YOU DESTROYED,
    (13)    5 POINTS FOR EACH STAR YOU DESTROYED, AND
    (14)    1 POINT FOR EACH CASUALTY YOU INCURRED.

     IN ADDITION TO YOUR SCORE, YOU MAY ALSO BE PROMOTED ONE GRADE
 IN RANK IF YOU PLAY WELL ENOUGH.  PROMOTION IS BASED PRIMARILY ON
 YOUR KLINGON/STARDATE KILL RATE, SINCE THIS IS THE BEST INDICATOR
 OF WHETHER YOU ARE READY TO GO ON TO THE NEXT HIGHER RATING.
 HOWEVER, IF YOU HAVE LOST 100 OR MORE POINTS IN PENALTIES, YOU
 WILL NOT RECEIVE A PROMOTION.

     YOU CAN BE PROMOTED FROM ANY LEVEL.  THERE IS A SPECIAL PROMOTION
 AVAILABLE IF YOU GO BEYOND THE "EXPERT" RANGE.  YOU CAN ALSO HAVE
 A CERTIFICATE OF MERIT PRINTED WITH YOUR NAME, DATE, AND
 KLINGON KILL RATE, PROVIDED YOU ARE PROMOTED FROM EITHER THE
 "EXPERT" OR "EMERITUS" LEVELS.

     YOU SHOULD PROBABLY START OUT AT THE NOVICE LEVEL, EVEN IF YOU
 ARE ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH ONE OF THE OTHER VERSIONS OF THE STAR TREK
 GAME--BUT, OF COURSE, THE LEVEL OF GAME YOU PLAY IS UP TO YOU.  IF
 YOU WANT TO START AT THE EXPERT LEVEL, GO AHEAD.  IT'S YOUR FUNERAL.
 THE EMERITUS GAME IS STRICTLY FOR MASOCHISTS.

                                                                        23

                  ----------MODIFICATIONS----------


     THE STAR TREK GAME IS SUPPORTED BY THE AUTHORS.  FROM TIME TO
 TIME, CORRECTIONS, MODIFICATIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE MADE IN
 THE GAME.  THE DOCUMENTATION FOR THE GAME (WHICH YOU ARE READING
 NOW) IS KEPT UP TO DATE, AND THE LATEST VERSION OF THE DOCUMENTATION
 IS AVAILABLE BY EXECUTING THE CONTROL CARDS:

          EXECPF 1234 GAMES.
 AND ENTERING  "TRKINST" AS YOUR GAME.

 PLAYERS WHO ALREADY HAVE A COPY OF THE DOCUMENTATION CAN KEEP
 ABREAST OF THE NEW MODIFICATIONS BY EXECUTING THE CONTROL CARDS:

          EXECPF 1234 GAMES.
 AND ENTERING "TRKNEWS" AS YOUR GAME.

 CORRECTIONS AND MINOR MODIFICATIONS (THOSE WHICH HAVE LITTLE EFFECT
 ON THE GAME) WILL NOT IN GENERAL BE REPORTED.

     CAVEAT:  SINCE THE GAME IS CONTINUALLY BEING IMPROVED, IT IS
 POSSIBLE THAT NEW REVISIONS WILL ALTER THE NATURE OF TOURNAMENT
 GAMES OR WILL RENDER PREVIOUSLY FROZEN GAMES UNPLAYABLE.  THE
 AUTHORS WILL ATTEMPT TO AVOID SUCH OCCURRANCES WHEREVER POSSIBLE
 AND TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS WHEN THEY DO OCCUR, BUT CANNOT MAKE
 ANY GUARANTEES.

 COURSES ARE GIVEN IN MANUAL MODE IN X - Y DISPLACEMENTS; IN AUTOMATIC
     MODE AS DESTINATION QUADRANT AND/OR SECTOR.  MANUAL MODE IS DEFAULT.
 DISTANCES ARE GIVEN IN QUADRANTS.  A DISTANCE OF ONE SECTOR IS 0.1 QUADRANT.
 ORDINARY KLINGONS HAVE ABOUT 400 UNITS OF ENERGY, COMMANDERS ABOUT
     1200.  ROMULANS NORMALLY HAVE ABOUT 800 UNITS OF ENERGY, AND THE
     (GULP) "SUPER-COMMANDER" HAS ABOUT 1800.
 PHASER FIRE DIMINISHES TO ABOUT 60 PERCENT AT 5 SECTORS.  UP TO 1500
     UNITS MAY BE FIRED IN A SINGLE BURST WITHOUT DANGER OF OVERHEAT.
 WARP 6 IS THE FASTEST SAFE SPEED.  AT HIGHER SPEEDS, ENGINE DAMAGE
     MAY OCCUR.  AT WARP 10 YOU MAY ENTER A TIME WARP.
 SHIELDS COST 50 UNITS OF ENERGY TO RAISE, AND DOUBLE THE POWER
     REQUIREMENTS OF MOVING UNDER WARP DRIVE.  ENGAGING THE HIGH-SPEED
     SHIELD CONTROL REQUIRES 200 UNITS OF ENERGY.
 WARP DRIVE REQUIRES (DISTANCE)*(WARP FACTOR CUBED) UNITS OF ENERGY
     TO TRAVEL AT A SPEED OF (WARP FACTOR SQUARED)/10 QUADRANTS PER STARDATE.
 IMPULSE ENGINES REQUIRE 20 UNITS TO WARM UP, PLUS 100 UNITS PER
     QUADRANT.  SPEED IS JUST UNDER ONE SECTOR PER STARDATE.

               ----------ACKNOWLEDGMENTS----------


     THE AUTHORS WOULD LIKE TO THANK PROFESSOR MICHAEL DUGGAN FOR
 HIS ENCOURAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANCE WITH THE DEVELOPMENT
 OF THE STAR TREK GAME, WITHOUT WHICH IT MIGHT NEVER HAVE BEEN
 COMPLETED.

     MUCH CREDIT IS DUE TO PATRICK MCGEHEARTY AND RICH COHEN, WHO
 ASSISTED WITH THE ORIGINAL DESIGN OF THE GAME AND CONTRIBUTED
 GREATLY TO ITS CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT.

     THANKS ARE ALSO DUE TO CARL STRANGE, HARDY TICHENOR AND STEVEN
 BRUELL FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE WITH CERTAIN CODING PROBLEMS.

     THIS GAME WAS INSPIRED BY AND RATHER LOOSELY BASED ON AN EARLIER
 GAME, PROGRAMMED IN THE BASIC LANGUAGE, BY JIM KORP AND GRADY HICKS.
 IT IS THE AUTHORS' UNDERSTANDING THAT THE BASIC GAME WAS IN TURN
 DERIVED FROM A STILL EARLIER VERSION IN USE AT PENN STATE UNIVERSITY.
