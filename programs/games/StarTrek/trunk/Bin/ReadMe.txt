		1. MODIFICATIONS  TO  ORIGINAL VERSION OF THIS GAME
		===================================================


	WHEN I STARTED TESTING THE GAME,  I NOTICED THAT NO MATTER HOW HARD
	I AM TRYING TO BEAT THE 'EMERITUS' LEVEL - THERE IS SIMPLY NOT MUCH
	LUCK ON MY SIDE.   WELL,  I DECIDED TO ADD SOME POWER-UPS TO REMEDY
	THIS SITUATION.


	1.1	WHEN  'DOCK'  COMMAND  IS  EXECUTED  SOMETIMES  MORE PHOTON
	LAUNCHERS ARE ADDED,  SO SHIP CAN FIRE MORE PHOTON TORPEDOES IN ONE
	BURST.  THIS EVENT HAPPENS ONLY ONCE PER GAME (FOR NOW).

	THE NUMBER OF TORPEDOES PER BURST IS INDICATED ON  'TORPEDOES' LINE
	IN SHORT RANGE SCAN REPORT.   MAXIMUM  NUMBER OF ADDED LAUNCHERS IS
	THREE, SO IN ALL SHIP CAN HAVE UP TO SIX TORPEDOES FIRED PER BURST!


	1.2	WHEN 'DOCK' COMMAND IS EXECUTED IT IS POSSIBLE SOMETIMES TO
	RECEIVE QUANTUM TORPEDOES INSTEAD OF NORMAL ONES.   THESE  ARE  NEW
	WARHEADS DESIGNED BY STARFLEET ENGINEER CORPS.  THE QUANTUM CHARGES
	DO NOT SUFFER THE LOSS OF TARGETING WHEN PASSING THROUGH SHIELDS AS
	MUCH AS NORMAL TORPEDOES.   AND OF COURSE, THEY PACK QUITE A PUNCH!

	"ENTERPRISE"  WILL  RECEIVE  SIXTEEN  QUANTUM  CHARGES  AND "FAERIE
	QUEENE" WILL GET EIGHT.  THESE CHARGES MUST BE EXPENDED BEFORE  THE
	NEXT  DOCKING  PROCEDURE,  OTHERWISE  THE  TORPEDOES  WILL  NOT  BE
	REFILLED BY THE BASE.  SO, DO NOT SAVE YOUR QUANTUM TORPEDOERS! GET
	INTO SOME QUADRANT AND MAKE A SHOOTING GALLERY OUT OF POOR SUCKERS!
	ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE SIX PHOTON TUBES.


	I WAS THINKING TO ADD SOME NEW WAYS TO GATHER ENERGY IN GALAXY, BUT
	SO FAR NOTHING COMES TO MIND.  IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS ON THAT I WILL
	BE GLAD TO HEAR IT.


	1.3	ANOTHER NICE TO HAVE MODIFICATION  IS THAT  OUTPUT HAS TRUE
	COLOURS.  THESE  COLOURS  ARE  NOT  STANDARD WIN32 CONSOLE COLOURS,
	BUT IN FACT, MY CONSOLE WINDOW IS A REAL WIN32 WINDOW, SIMULATING A
	CONSOLE I/O.


	1.4	SOME DELAY ADDED WHEN OUTPUTTING LARGE AMOUNTS OF DATA - IT
	IMPROVES READABILITY, SINCE I HAVE NOT IMPLEMENTED THE SCROLLING OF
	MY CONSOLE WINDOW (FOR NOW).


	1.5.	NEW 'LOG' COMMAND ADDED INTO THE GAME. IT ALLOWS SAVING ALL
	GAME I/O INTO THE FILE CALLED 'STARTREK.LOG'.   THIS  FILE  IS  RE-
	CREATED EACH GAME, SO IF YOU NEED TO ANALYSE ANY PREVIOUS GAMES YOU
	HAVE TO RENAME THAT FILE AFTER THE GAME.


	1.6	SINCE I HAVE  TRUE COLOURS IN THE GAME I DECIDED TO IMPROVE
	THE GALAXY CHART.  ALL QUADRANTS WHERE 'SRSCAN' COMMAND  WAS  GIVEN
	WILL BE HIGHLIGHTED WITH  DIFFERENT COLOUR.  IT  MAY  BE  USEFUL IN
	LOCATING A PLANET.  ALSO, THE SHIP'S QUADRANT IS HIGHLIGHTED TOO.



			2. SOME STRATEGY HINTS
			======================


	"STAR TREK"  IS  A  GAME OF STRATEGY.  I  GOT  THAT  WHILE  PLAYING
	IT DURING MY TESTING PHASE  -  I WAS  PLAYING  FOR HOURS EVERY DAY!

	I GOT A LOT OF BUGS FIXED, AND AT THE SAME TIME I GOT SOME INSIGHTS
	INTO THE GAME.  MOST OF THESE CAME WITH A KNOWLEDGE OF READING  THE
	SOURCE CODE FROM PDP-11.  HOWEVER, I CAN ADD SOME OF MY OWN.   AND,
	OF COURSE, SOME LUCK IS MUCH NEEDED,  ESPECIALLY ON THE "EMERITUS"!

	SO, LET'S BEGIN!..


	2.1	IMAGINE THAT  YOU  HEAR ON SUBSPACE,  THAT  A BASE IS UNDER
	ATTACK AND YOU REALISE THAT TO GET THERE AT WARP 5  OR EVEN AT WARP
	6 IS NOT POSSIBLE.   YOU HAVE THE ENERGY,  BUT THE MOVE  WITH WARPS
	OVER 6 WILL  DAMAGE  THE  ENGINES AND YOU'LL GET STRANDED OR YOU'LL
	HAVE TO DRAG AT WARP 4.   IN SUCH A CASE  I USE WARP 8,  BUT I MAKE
	SHORT TRIPS - EACH TRIP IS NO LONGER  THAN  5 SECTORS.   THERE IS A
	PROBABILITY OF DAMAGING THE ENGINES,  BUT  THAT PROBABILITY IS MUCH
	LOWER FOR SHORT JUMPS.  ALSO, GO WITH SHIELDS DOWN TO  SAVE ENERGY.
	IF YOU GET TRACTORED  -  YOU'LL  HAVE A CHANCE TO RAISE SHIELDS FOR
	BATTLE.  IN FACT, ALWAYS LOWER SHIELDS, WHEN BATTLE IS OVER.


	2.2	IF YOU REALISE THAT BASE WILL BE DESTROYED AND YOU STILL IN
	A NEIGHBOURING QUADRANT AND NOT ENOUGH TIME TO GET TO BASE - 'HELP'
	COMMAND CAN BE USED TO JUMP STRAIGHT INTO DOCK.  HOWEVER, THIS  MAY
	END BADLY,  BECAUSE  'HELP'  COMMAND IS PRONE TO RE-MATERIALIZATION
	FAILURE AND YOU'LL LOSE THE GAME.  ON THE OTHER HAND, JAMES T. KIRK
	LOVES TO RISK!  AND YOU ARE BECOME HIM, REMEMBER?..


	2.3	WHEN  YOU  ENTER  THE  QUADRANT WITH ENEMIES  - THEY ATTACK
	RIGHT AWAY.  YOU CAN ATTACK WHEN THEIR ATTACK IS OVER, HOWEVER, YOU
	HAVE ONE CHANCE TO  MOVE  BEFORE  ATTACKING, SO USE IT WISELY.  FOR
	EXAMPLE, YOU CAN FLY INTO THE MIDDLE OF ENEMIES,  SO  YOUR  WEAPONS
	WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE ON THE SHORT DISTANCE.  IT  WORKS  FOR BOTH
	PHASERS (LESS ENERGY SPENT ON A BURST) AND TORPEDOES (PRECISION AND
	HIT ENERGY WILL BE INTENSIFIED).


	2.4	SIMPLE FACT:  WHEN STAR IS HIT BY A TORPEDO  - IT BECOMES A
	NOVA. NOVA DESTROYS (OR HEAVILY DAMAGES)  ALL OBJECTS IN 8 ADJACENT
	SECTORS.  YOU CAN USE IT IN BATTLE.  IF  YOU  HAVE ONLY 2 TORPEDOES
	LEFT, BUT THERE ARE 5 KLINGONS  IN  THE  QUADRANT,  HOWEVER,  THESE
	ENEMIES ARE ADJACENT TO TWO STARS.  THEY ARE UNLUCKY ONES! FLY INTO
	A POSITION, WHERE YOUR TORPEDOES WILL SURELY HIT  THOSE  STARS  AND
	FIRE!  ENEMIES WILL BE DESTROYED (MOST LIKELY).  THERE IS  A  SMALL
	PROBABILITY THAT NOVA CAN BECOME A SUPERNOVA - THAT WOULD BE BAD. I
	ONCE EXPERIENCED THAT IN MY TESTING.


	2.5	BEWARE  OF  ROMULANS!  -  THEY  HAVE  MORE POWER THAN  MOST
	KLINGONS.  ALSO, THEY USUALLY FIRE TORPEDOES - NOT A GOOD PROSPECT.
	TRY TO KILL OFF ROMULANS (AND COMMANDERS) FIRST WHEN IN BATTLE.


	2.6	ALWAYS TRY TO ENTER THE CORNER SECTOR  OF  A  QUADRANT WITH
	ENEMIES OR CLOSE TO CORNER SECTOR.  IT MINIMIZES  THE  ENEMY  POWER
	AND THEY CANNOT INFLICT AS MUCH DAMAGE AS IF YOU  ENTER THE  SECTOR
	5-5.  ALSO, IF YOU AT CORNER SECTOR -  IT KEEPS  THE  THOLIAN  FROM
	MOVING AND WEAVING ITS WEB.


	2.7	SOMETIMES YOU NEED A QUICK SCAN OF THE  GALAXY.  IT  CAN BE
	DONE WITHOUT TOO MUCH ENERGY SPENT ON FLIGHT.   SIMPLY FLY INTO ANY
	CORNER OF THE QUADRANT AND THEN MOVE JUST ONE SECTOR TO GET  TO THE
	ADJACENT QUADRANT AND GIVE BOTH 'SRSCAN' AND 'LRSCAN' COMMANDS.  BY
	DOING IT ONLY THREE TIMES (3 SECTORS TRAVELLED) YOU CAN  SCAN  FOUR
	QUADRANTS ON SHORT RANGE AND TWELVE ON LONG RANGE.


	2.8	AFTER THE BATTLE ALWAYS KEEP YOUR SHIELDS ON FULL OR  CLOSE
	TO FULL.   YOU CAN  BE TRACTORED BY A COMMANDER AT ANY TIME AND YOU
	WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TRANSFER THE ENERGY - ONLY TO RAISE SHIELDS.


	2.9	HOW TO FIGHT A LOT OF KLINGONS?   IMAGINE  THAT YOU ENTER A
	QUADRANT AND IT HAS SEVEN KLINGONS OR MORE.  EXPERIENCE SHOWS  THAT
	TO KILL ALL ENEMIES WITH PHASER IS NOT FEASIBLE WITHOUT OVERHEATING
	PHASERS.  IN THIS CASE THE MANUAL PHASER  FIRE  WILL  HELP.   USING
	THIS METHOD YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH ENERGY  IS  NEEDED  TO  KILL  EACH
	ENEMY.  SIMPLY ENTER FOR EACH ENEMY SOME AMOUNT OF  FIRE KEEPING IN
	MIND THAT PHASERS BEGIN  OVERHEATING  AT  MORE  THAN  1500 UNITS IN
	TOTAL.  THE OVERHEATING IS  HIGHLY  RANDOM  -  I ONCE FIRED 2500 AT
	SUPER-COMMANDER IN A FAR DISTANCE  (COULD NOT MOVE CLOSER)  AND  MY
	PHASERS WERE NOT OVERHEATED!  SO, WHEN YOU ENTER THE MANUAL AMOUNTS
	FOR EACH ENEMY AND FIRE - IT WILL WEAKEN THE ENEMIES,  SO THEY WILL
	NOT BE ABLE TO FIRE AS MUCH IN THEIR NEXT WAVE OF ATTACK.  USUALLY,
	YOUR SECOND PHASER SHOT WILL KILL ALL SEVEN KLINGONS.  YOUR RESULTS
	MAY VARY, HOWEVER!  THAT'S WHY THIS GAME IS SO ADDICTIVE!  ANYTHING
	CAN HAPPEN DURING BATTLE!


	2.10	IF THE ENEMY IS CLOSE TO BLACK HOLE  (PREFERABLY  1  SECTOR
	DISTANCE) - IT IS POSSIBLE TO DISPLACE THAT ENEMY INTO A BLACK HOLE
	WITH A TORPEDO FIRED ON THE SAME VECTOR.  I ONCE WAS IN A SITUATION
	DEPICTED BELOW  AND  WAS ABLE TO KILL SUPER-COMMANDER WITH JUST ONE
	NORMAL TORPEDO!


		. E . . S @ . . .



			3. NEED FOR IMPROVEMENT
			=======================


	3.1	I WOULD BE HAPPY TO HEAR SOME NEW IDEAS ABOUT THE GAME. YOU
	CAN E-MAIL ME (asmguru62@hotmail.com) TO GIVE AN INSIGHT OR ADVICE.


	3.2	I WAS NOT HAPPY TO DISCOVER (READING THE SOURCE CODE)  THAT
	COMMANDER'S TRACTOR  BEAM  WORKS ON A GREAT DISTANCES.   BASICALLY,
	THE SHIP CAN BE PULLED FROM ONE CORNER OF THE GALAXY TO THE OTHER!!
	THAT DOES NOT SEEM LOGICAL TO ME.  I WANTED TO ADJUST THE  GAME, SO
	THE DISTANCE WILL BE A FACTOR, BUT I LEFT THAT AS IS -  TO PRESERVE
	THE ORIGINAL IDEA FOR NOW.


	3.3	BUGS!! OF COURSE, I AM GLAD TO HEAR SOME BUG REPORTS. LET'S
	MAKE IT A NICE GAMING EXPERIENCE - 70s STYLE!..    DURING TESTING I
	HAVE SEEN SOME STRANGE ISSUES, HOWEVER, I WAS NOT ABLE TO REPRODUCE
	THESE IN A CONSISTENT MANNER.


	3.4	TAKE A LOOK AT POSITION BELOW:

		  1 2 3 4 5
		1 E * . . .
		2 . . . . .

	TO MOVE TO SECTOR  2-2  THE SHIP NEEDS TO TRAVEL AT 45 DEGREE ANGLE
	DOWN AND TO THE RIGHT AND IT SEEMS LIKE NOTHING IN THE WAY.  BEWARE
	OF SUCH CONDITION - IN MOST CASES THE SHIP WILL BE BLOCKED BY  STAR
	AT SECTOR 1-2.  I ANALYSED THE CODE AND IT SEEMS,  WHEN SHIP MOVES,
	IT WILL  APPROXIMATE ITS  LOCATION TO  THE NEAREST SECTOR WITH HALF
	SECTOR PRECISION.  FOR EXAMPLE: SECTOR  1-1.5  WILL  BE ROUNDED  TO
	SECTOR 1-2 AND THIS WILL CAUSE COLLISION WITH OBJECT AT THAT SECTOR
	IF ANY.  THAT SEEMS ILLOGICAL,  AS SPOCK WOULD SAY.   HALF  OF  THE
	SECTOR CANNOT BE COMPARED  WITH  THE  SHIP'S  LENGTH  TO BE ABLE TO
	COLLIDE WITH ANYTHING.  I ALSO, LEFT THAT FACT INTACT FROM ORIGINAL
	CODE.   SIMPLY DO NOT PLOT YOUR COURSE TOO CLOSE  TO OTHER OBJECTS.

	THE SAME CONDITION EXISTS FOR TORPEDOES TOO,  BECAUSE THE SAME CODE
	IS USED TO MOVE A TORPEDO.



			4. FASM SOURCE CODE
			===================


	I HAVE INSERTED  THE  ORIGINAL  COPYRIGHT NOTE FROM PDP-11  FORTRAN
	SOURCE. YOU CAN MODIFY THE CODE, BIT ONLY FOR FUN - NOT FOR PROFIT.

	THE SOURCE CODE WAS NOT WRITTEN TO BE FAST. IT WAS WRITTEN TO MIMIC
	EXACTLY THE LOGIC OF FORTRAN SOURCE.  PLEASE  DO NOT ASK ME TO MAKE
	OPTIMIZATIONS IN THE CODE - IT WILL NEVER BE DONE.  I  USED  MY OWN
	IDE FOR FASM TO CREATE THAT CODE.   YOU  CAN  LOOK  AT THE DATES IN
	FILES AND FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH TIME IT TOOK TO WRITE THAT CODE. THIS
	WAS MY THIRD (!) ATTEMPT TO RE-CREATE ONE OF MY FAVOURITE GAMES.

	IN THE FIRST ATTEMPT I TRIED TO RE-DESIGN THE ORIGINAL SOURCE TO BE
	MORE STRUCTURED.  NO NEED TO SAY - IT FAILED MISERABLY!  THE  LOGIC
	IN SOME CASES WAS LOST.

	IN THE SECOND ATTEMPT  I  WROTE THE FASM CODE TO MIMIC FORTRAN CODE
	EXACTLY. HOWEVER, I FAILED TO SEE THAT THERE SHOULD BE TWO THREADS.
	ONE THREAD SHOULD RUN THE CONSOLE WINDOW AND THE  OTHER  ONE SHOULD
	DEAL WITH GAME LOGIC: QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FROM CONSOLE.

	WELL, THIRD TIME'S A CHARM!
