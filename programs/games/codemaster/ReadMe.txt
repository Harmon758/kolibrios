3 GAMES FOR KOLIBRI (AND WINDOWS)

Binary Master: Fun game for programmers.
Practice binary arithmetic.

Hang Programmer: Teaches English words/phrases
related to programming

Puzzle Challenge: Custom game for Kolibri.
Tests your visual attention to fine details.
If you solve the puzzle, lines will disappear
and there will be a message. Look close into
the clouds and direction of lights.

Written in FASM(1) macros, Abakis advanced language
+ library, 7,000+ lines, custom graphics and fonts.
Spent the most time on this library.

* Created by codemaster (codemazt3r@gmail.com)
* Educational games made specifically for programmers.
* Very clear professional style, good examples
for the community.
* First portable games written in FASM. Assembles
on/for both Kolibri and Windows with the same
source just by changing the first 1-2 lines
in A.INC. Allows programmers to create games
_for_Kolibri_ on Windows
* 24-27 years of programming experience,
recreationally in my freetime. Made 1,000s of
programs, given 100s of examples away for free
while poor. Never been paid.

Thanks. Happy new years!
