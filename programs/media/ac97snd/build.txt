Building AC97SND on windows.

1. Tools required:

- Microsoft Visual Studio (version 2005 or later)

- Flat assembler 
Download and install fasm for windows from http://www.flatassembler.net
Add fasm directory to windows PATH variable.
(To check if this worked, open CMD and type fasm. Fasm's help messages should be visible now.)

- pe2kos.exe 
Can be found in some subdirectorys of SVN, official location unknown.
This file will need to be placed in the same directory as dependecies, to build the final kolibrios executable

2. Collecting the dependencies:

- sound.lib 
Source code can be found at SVN\programs\develop\sdk\trunk\sound\src
Building this is beyond the scope of this document for now.
If you cant figure it out, or are lazy, you can download latest compiled version from autobuild server.
http://builds.kolibrios.org/eng/data/programs/develop/sdk/trunk/sound/src/sound.lib

- ufmod.obj
Source code is at SVN\programs\develop\libraries\ufmod
Build using makeobj.bat
Or as above, download from:
http://builds.kolibrios.org/eng/data/programs/develop/libraries/ufmod/ufmod.obj

- mpg.obj
Open ac97snd solution in visual studio, select mpg project and click build -> build mpg


3. Building AC97SND binary

You will need to copy all previously mentioned dependecies into the folder that visual studio expects to find them.
This can be for example: SVN\programs\media\ac97snd\release\
Alternatively, you can add another directory to 'Additional Library Directorys' in Projects Linker options.
Now select AC97SND project, and click build -> build AC97SND


good luck!
