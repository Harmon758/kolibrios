1. Why it need?
---------------------
The problem of "60 Hz" is falling stand before of users of MeOS in modern condisions.
As a rule, most modern computers consist of 17" monitor (all written later is not actual
for owners of LCD monitors). If on 14" or 15" monitors the problem of "60 Hz" not a
main, but with 17" monitor it's a most pantfull. And with more size monitors I have no 
words for discusion: it's a slade-show. Of couse, all of the upper correlated with 
standart interface of VESA. As for VESA 3.0 - yes, interface have more rich features, 
but it have no possiblity of change videomode in protect mode (the Virtual86 not realized
in MeOS !!!!!).

The MeOS not known as a detected devices on boot, it setting of standard VESA videomode
with 60 Hz vertical refrash rate !

This programm  is a FreeWare. And distribute "AS IS ...". Author not 
carreing responsibility for probable damage  :) .

!!!!!_Warning_!!!!!:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
! On this time programm have a EXPERIMENTAL status (!). And this reason you have a   !
! chance destroy own device (monitor). Espesialy this taking attantionall users with !
! monitor without of rate protection.                                                !
! If you decide using this util I have a suggestion: fill of information form and    !

2. Installation.
-----------------
Extract file VRR (it's ordinary executed MeOS file) from archive and situated it on
C:\ root or MeOS floppy. In main, VRR may situated on any directory (you must have
possibility run this file under MeOS).


3. Using.
----------
The VRR is a standard executed file of Menuet Operation System. You may send on 
execute this file by SYSTREE or MASH.

After redraw of programm window will be present of current vertical refrash rate
and table with possibiling videoregimes. It's sorrably, table have VERY small 
videomode (the programm is experimental).

   Change of videomode
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You may select interesting videomode using _ONLY_ numerical keys: 1,2,3,4 and 5. 
In a first step you must select resolution of videoregime. In a second step - need 
select of vertical refresh rate. All changes are indicated on screen in a the 
programm window. After select videomode, to set mode you must press "Enter" or 
button "Ok". Notification: in this time all executing MeOS programs will be
killing. It this needed for minimize artefacts of the screen. After change videomode
you have a two way. First way: you can not any doing and after 13 seconds waiting 
return last videomode. Second way: press two-three time any key or some time mouse 
click on artefacts of VRR (or this plase) and fixing selected mode. Also you have 
possibility modification of horizontal screen size by button "Left"\"Right" or keys 
"+\-". For correcting your select you may use button "Cancel".

Also in programm realized return at initial videomode with 60 Hz vertical refresh 
by button "Default". And you may return in last videomode by button "Return" or 
key "r"

Note:
~~~~~~
In this time programm may change vertical refresh rate _ONLY_ by lowing screen 
resolution, because this method will be using at most part videocard 
(VGA, SVGA or modern)

Example:
If you have videomode 1024x768x60Hz and if you want select 800x600x95Hz, you must
press key "3" and key "1". After that key "Enter" or button "Ok". And after redraw
screen two time click on last program window position. If need using button 
"Left\Right" for correcting horizontal size.
