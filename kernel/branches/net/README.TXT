This code is experimental, none of the used programming interfaces (API, driver calls,..) are definite solutions.
Lot of work needs to be done, and descissions need to be made.

But, everyone is free to explore the code, make suggestions or write parts of the code.

I'm open for discussion on hidnplayr@gmail.com or as hidnplayr in #kolibrios on the freenode IRC network.
Some information about API and things under construction can be found on http://wiki.kolibrios.org/wiki/New_stack
Binary versions can be found at http://builds.kolibrios.org/new-stack/

All bug reports may be sent to me via e-mail, or through the bugtracker on http://bugs.kolibrios.org
