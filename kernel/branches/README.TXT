This code is experimental, none of the used programming interfaces (API, driver calls,..) are definite solutions.
Lot of work needs to be done, and descissions need to be made.

But, everyone is free to explore the code, make suggestions or write parts of the code.

I'm open for discussion on hidnplayr@gmail.com or as hidnplayr in #general on irc.kolibrios.org:6667

PS: dont expect anything to be working at al, this way you wont be dissapointed ;)
