1. create asm listing:
compile .o only, then use objdump
kos32-tcc.exe -c -g clipview.c -o clipviewtcc.o
kos32-objdump -d -M intel -S -l clipviewtcc.o > clipviewtcc.asm

2. see offset in resulting kolibri executable compared to listing (i have 0xD0)

3. in kolibri debugger mtdbg set breakpoint to funtion address 
>bp 140
where 0x140 is 0x70 in assemly + offset 0xD0


Warning !!Error. sometimes tcc dont warn about unsuccesful linking 
(not found function body code). Hopefully, i fix this.

Usually, at runtime you have crash with "Illegal cpu instruction"
In assembler code this is easy to recognize as 
myaddr:E8 FC FF FF FF  call myaddr+1  

4.how to see defines
kos32-tcc.exe -E -dD null

5.if you use GNU LD as a linker, add option -Map=hellocpp.map to ld.
Mtdbg can use resulting .map file 

6.now you can use -g option to generate .dbg file. This enables 
source code level debugging with Mtdbg
